/**
 * deploy-trigger-auth.mjs — sign/verify `mesh.deploy.trigger` payloads.
 *
 * Closes the fleet-RCE hole (deep review 2026-07-03, C2): the deploy listener
 * runs `git reset --hard` + deploy on ANY message to `mesh.deploy.trigger`,
 * trusting it purely because it arrived on NATS. Anyone with NATS publish
 * access could push arbitrary code to every node.
 *
 * This wraps the existing ed25519 layer (lib/node-identity.mjs) into two
 * deploy-specific helpers. It is OPT-IN and backward-compatible:
 *
 *   OPENCLAW_REQUIRE_SIGNED_DEPLOY unset/0 (default)
 *     — verifyDeployTrigger accepts everything (current behavior), but logs a
 *       warning when a trigger is unsigned so the exposure is visible.
 *   OPENCLAW_REQUIRE_SIGNED_DEPLOY=1 (strict)
 *     — a trigger must carry a cryptographically valid signature AND be fresh
 *       AND be signed by a key on the deploy-trust allowlist. Fail-closed: if
 *       no allowlist is configured, every trigger is rejected.
 *
 * The allowlist is OPENCLAW_DEPLOY_TRUSTED_KEYS: comma-separated base64 raw
 * ed25519 public keys (the `publicKeyBase64` from getOrCreateIdentity / the
 * `signer_pubkey` field signEvent stamps). Provision it with the lead's key
 * before enabling strict mode.
 *
 * NOTE: not runtime-verifiable against a live mesh in this repo (the mesh is
 * dormant); covered by unit tests at the sign/verify level.
