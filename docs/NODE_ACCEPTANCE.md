# Node Acceptance Protocol

**Status:** Built for single-node. On 2026-09-30, disposable `qwen3:8b` fixtures at `b8ea264`
and `be579f3` each passed the then-current 7-check memory-axis gate. The real daemon imported
and indexed a separately watched session, persisted a nonce-linked SQLite decision, and returned
it through injection. The gold probes took 576 s and 381 s. Those runs' watcher alerts counted
two idempotent no-ops *after* a successful first extraction as failures; that classification is
corrected. A third isolated run after `be579f3`, using the revised required watcher probe, was
**REJECTED** on 2026-09-30 at 07:32 EDT (6 PASS, 2 FAIL). The parser rejected its first model
response as containing another JSON object. The daemon fell back to regex, no SQLite decision was
stored within 1022 s, and the watcher emitted `extraction_failure`. The stricter gate correctly
rejected that run. These are isolated memory-path results, not full-node acceptance: extraction reliability, clean install,
restart recovery, memory quality, production latency and two-machine execution remain open.
With the Qwen3 non-thinking primer aligned to its template, a fourth isolated run on 2026-09-30
at 08:03 EDT was **ACCEPTED** (8 PASS). Its daemon imported and indexed four turns, stored the
synthetic SQLite decision, and returned that decision through the injector; the gold round-trip
took 649 s and the watcher observed a clean first extraction. One green run after a red run does
not establish first-attempt reliability. After the harness terminated it, the daemon logged
`Daemon stopped` but the native runtime then aborted with a mutex error (`SIGABRT`). Restarting
against the same fixture state restored the injector and isolated runtime paths; no duplicate
gold extraction appeared during a 15 s observation. The native abort remains unresolved.
`bin/node-acceptance.mjs` + `lib/node-acceptance.mjs` +
`lib/node-acceptance-probes.mjs` implement L0–L2 + L4 hard-tests across memory / LLM / network.
Inter-node L3 is specified but deferred (§8).
**Owner principle:** MASTER_PLAN §4.1 (code on disk ≠ shipped), §4.7 (tests are not done-criteria),
§5 (done requires runtime evidence). This protocol is the operational instance of §5 applied to a
*whole node* rather than a single step.

## 0. Running it (the built global system check)

```bash
node bin/node-acceptance.mjs            # full single-node gate, hard-tests every component
npm run node-check                      # same, via package script
openclaw-node-check                     # same, after `npm i -g` / link (bin entry)
node bin/node-acceptance.mjs --axis llm # one axis: memory | llm | network | storage
node bin/node-acceptance.mjs --no-mutate# skip probes that write synthetic data
node bin/node-acceptance.mjs --deep     # include invasive probes (e.g. extract-trigger)
node bin/node-acceptance.mjs --json --report /path/report.md
node bin/run-memory-fixture.mjs         # disposable real daemon/bus/injector + memory gate
node bin/run-memory-fixture.mjs --startup-only # verify isolated service startup without the gold probe
```

Exit codes: **0** ACCEPTED · **1** REJECTED · **2** INCOMPLETE · **3** harness error. Writes an evidence
report to `~/.openclaw/.node-acceptance.md` by default. **Portable:** every path/URL/port/model resolves
from the same env vars the deployed components read (`OPENCLAW_HOME`, `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE`,
`OPENCLAW_NODE_ID`, `LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_MODEL`, `MEMORY_INJECT_PORT`, `NATS_MONITOR_URL`,
`OPENCLAW_NATS`, …), so the same binary self-tests any node, including `spawn-node` trees via
`OPENCLAW_HOME=~/.openclaw-<id>`.

**Deployment integration:** run as a post-deploy gate (CI / `mesh-deploy-listener`), or schedule
periodically alongside `health-watch`. A non-zero exit means the node is not 100% — see §10.

---

## 1. Why this exists

A node has three independent notions of "working", and the existing tooling only covers two:

| Question | Answered by today | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| Is the code *correct*? | 69 test files / 1414 unit+integration tests (mocked NATS, in-process) | proves logic, not a deployed node |
| Is each part *running*? | `lib/health-check.mjs` `runHealthCheck()` + the `health-watch` daemon (6 liveness probes) | proves a PID exists, not that the function works |
| Does the whole node *function* end-to-end? | **nothing** | **this protocol** |

The failure mode this guards against is the May-2026 one (MASTER_PLAN intro): "the daemon starts and
prints *startup complete* while hiding three disabled subsystems." A green PID and a passing test suite
both reported success while the node produced ~0 working behavior. **Liveness ≠ acceptance.**

`bin/openclaw-status.mjs` is *not* an acceptance gate either: it greps daemon **source** statically and
(per COMPONENT_REGISTRY cross-component issues) introspects the *wrong* daemon, reporting false
`NOT_WIRED`. **This protocol probes the running runtime, never source.**

"100%" is defined precisely here: every **required** check in the node's profile returns `PASS` **with
captured runtime evidence**. Anything unobservable is `SKIP`/`BLOCK`, never `PASS` — fake-passing is the
cardinal failure (same rule the tick-chain runs on, PROTOCOL §7).

---

## 2. Scope of this round

- **In scope:** single-node acceptance — layers **L0, L1, L2, L4** across the **memory**, **LLM-backing**,
  and **network (local)** axes.
- **Deferred (operator decision 2026-06-15):** layer **L3 inter-node / federation**. It is *specified*
  here (§8) so the later round starts from a contract, but it is not built this round and is reported
  `N/A (deferred)` on a single node — never `PASS`, never `FAIL`. Rationale: federation is `ABSENT` in the
  live runtime (COMPONENT_REGISTRY 1.5; NATS is loopback-only single-node per 7.1; redesign D4 deferred it).

### Profiles

| Profile | Layers run | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `single-node` (default) | L0, L1, L2, L4; L3 → `N/A` | Accept one deployed node (today's reality). |
| `federated` (future) | + L3 against a real or `spawn-node` peer | Accept a node's links to other nodes (§8). |

The harness also accepts `--axis memory|llm|network|storage|e2e` to run one axis in isolation.

---

## 3. The gate model

Five layers, ascending in integration. A node is accepted only when **all required checks across all
active-profile layers** are `PASS`.

| Layer | Proves | Evidence class |
|---|---|---|
| **L0 Presence** | every part is *deployed* (no deploy gap, §4.1) | file stat · `readlink` · `diff -rq` · `launchctl list` · perms |
| **L1 Liveness** | every part is *running* | PID · port listen · `launchctl` PID · HTTP `healthz` |
| **L2 Functional** | each part *does its job* in isolation | SQL row-delta · HTTP body · generated text · vector dims |
| **L3 Inter-node** | the link to *other nodes* is real + reliable | observed offer/accept · rejected forgery · reconnect log *(deferred §8)* |
| **L4 End-to-end** | the *whole loop* works | a unique fact ingested becomes retrievable / injected upstream |

### Check verdicts

- `PASS` — observed, threshold met, evidence captured.
- `FAIL` — observed, threshold missed (gate goes red).
- `SKIP` — a precondition for *this* probe is absent in this profile (e.g. companion-bridge off); recorded, not counted against the gate, **must state why**.
- `N/A` — out of profile (e.g. all of L3 on `single-node`).
- `BLOCK` — the probe *should* run but cannot observe (tool missing, headless-only). Treated as `FAIL` for the gate. Never silently downgraded to `PASS`.

### Gate rule

```
accepted  ⇔  (no FAIL) ∧ (no BLOCK) ∧ (every required check is PASS)
```

The harness runs **all** layers (no early abort) so one report shows the full picture, then computes the
gate. Exit code: `0` accepted, `1` rejected.

---

## 4. Axis: Memory function (the deepest)

The pipeline under test: `JSONL session → ingest → state.db → extraction (LLM) → entities/themes/mentions/
decisions → indexing (knowledge.db FTS+vec, graph-cache.db) → retrieval (5 channels) → inject :7893`.
Acceptance is a **round-trip**, not "the database opens".

Synthetic data carries a per-run nonce in a separate session. Teardown removes the rows it owns, but
the gold round-trip can mutate shared derived memory and the event log. Run that probe only in an
isolated fixture (§7.3–7.4).

| ID | Proves | Method | PASS threshold | Evidence captured | Builds on |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MEM-L0-1 | DBs deployed | stat the 3 DB files | `state.db`, `.knowledge.db`, `graph-cache.db` all present + non-empty | paths + sizes + mtimes | COMPONENT_REGISTRY 6.1 |
| MEM-L0-2 | inject token deployed | stat `~/.openclaw/config/memory-injection-token` | exists, mode `0600`, 64 bytes | `ls -l` line | 1.3 |
| MEM-L0-3 | watched sources configured | read `~/.openclaw/config/transcript-sources.json` | ≥1 source dir exists + readable | source list | 1.1 |
| MEM-L1-1 | daemon up | `launchctl list ai.openclaw.memory-daemon` → PID | PID present (reuse `parseLaunchctlPid`) | PID | health-check `checkDaemon` |
| MEM-L1-2 | inject server up | TCP connect `:7893` + `POST /memory/inject` no-token → `401` | listening + auth enforced | status code | 1.3 |
| MEM-L2-1 | **ingest works** | write a synthetic JSONL (nonce) into a watched source; poll `state.db` | `messages` count for the synthetic session grows within `pollInterval + 10s` | SQL before/after counts | session-store, append-delta 3.1 |
| MEM-L2-2 | **extraction works** | trigger flush on the synthetic session (`openclaw-extract-now` / NATS); poll extraction tables | ≥1 row in `entities` with fresh `created_at`; result schema-valid | SQL row + validation result | extraction-store, schema 3.4 |
| MEM-L2-3 | mentions carry grain | check `mentions.turn_index` for the synthetic rows | non-NULL on ≥1 mention | SQL value | 3.3 |
| MEM-L2-4 | FTS+vec indexed | query `knowledge.db` `last_indexed`; confirm synthetic chunks present | `last_indexed` advanced after the session; nonce findable in FTS | SQL + FTS hit | 5.1 |
| MEM-L2-5 | graph fresh | `graph-cache.db` `last_refresh_at` | within 1h (or advanced this run) | SQL value | 5.2 |
| MEM-L2-6 | **all 5 retrieval channels live** | `POST /memory/inject` with token + the known-good query | `concepts≥1 ∧ decisions≥1 ∧ snippets≥1`; each of FTS/vec/entity/theme/spreading returns ≥1 | response body (per-channel counts) | 1.3 v5.3 done-criterion |
| MEM-L2-7 | inject latency | time MEM-L2-6 (analysis-disabled or tolerant of the 1s LLM ceiling) | p95 < 500 ms excluding LLM analysis | measured ms | 1.3 target |
| MEM-L4-1 | **gold round-trip** | write a nonce transcript in the daemon's watched source under a session ID distinct from direct ingest; wait for the daemon's `sessions.message_count`, `session_documents.turn_count`, and durable decision; query inject for the database choice | the indexed session has all four messages, the decision has the nonce, SQLite and an embedded/portable rationale, and the returned `Recent decisions` section contains that decision | import/index counts + decision row + returned decision line | full pipeline; poll budget at least extraction budget + 120 s (`ACCEPT_ROUNDTRIP_POLL_MS`) |
| MEM-L2-WATCHER | watcher observing | inspect `~/.openclaw/watcher.jsonl` after the gold and inject probes | a fresh extraction and injection record; first extraction succeeds; no `watcher.alert` during the run | event count + alert state | 1.8 |

> **MEM-L4-1 is the crown probe.** It is the single check that proves *the memory function actually
> works* on this node: a fact that did not exist before the run is created, extracted, indexed, and
> retrieved by content. If only one memory check could run, it is this one.

---

## 5. Axis: LLM backing

Ollama-served generation + BGE-M3 embedding, model selected by `LLM_MODEL` (default `qwen3:8b`),
serialized through `lib/ollama-queue.mjs`. Acceptance proves the model **runs**, not that the server
answers `/api/tags`.

| ID | Proves | Method | PASS threshold | Evidence | Builds on |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LLM-L1-1 | server up | `GET :11434/api/tags` | HTTP 200 | model list | health-check `checkOllama` |
| LLM-L1-2 | **configured model present** | the model named by `LLM_MODEL` is in `/api/tags` | exact name match (not "some model") | matched tag | MASTER_PLAN 3.2 |
| LLM-L2-1 | **generation runs** | the production `llm-client` sends a short non-thinking streamed `/api/chat` request, or `/v1/chat/completions` when `LLM_NATIVE_API=false` | non-empty completion, within budget (default 30s, env `ACCEPT_GEN_BUDGET_MS`) | response text + completion tokens + ms | llm-client |
| LLM-L2-2 | **embedder runs** | embed a string with BGE-M3 via `@huggingface/transformers` | vector length = 1024, all finite, L2-norm > 0 | dim + norm | health-check `checkEmbedder`, embed-benchmark |
| LLM-L2-3 | **production task works** | run the structured-extraction path on a tiny synthetic transcript that rejects Postgres for a nonce-named project | schema-valid output links the nonce to the SQLite decision and its embedded/portable rationale, without choosing Postgres; within the production 600 s budget (override `ACCEPT_EXTRACT_BUDGET_MS`) | validation result + counts + ms | extraction-prompt/schema 3.4 |
| LLM-L2-4 | queue not stuck | read `ollama-queue` state snapshot | `consecutive_timeouts.{extraction,analysis} < 3`; no fallback in last 5 min | snapshot fields | ollama-queue, health-watch `deriveQueueStatus` |
| LLM-L0-1 | RAM headroom (advisory) | `bin/check-llm-baseline.mjs` | advisory only — `WARN` not `FAIL` if under recommendation | advisor output | MASTER_PLAN 3.2 |

> LLM-L2-3 is the LLM analogue of the gold round-trip: it proves the backing works for the *real* task
> (a schema-valid decision grounded in the transcript), not just freeform text. A model that generates prose but fails
> structured extraction is a failed LLM backing for this node's purpose.

---

## 6. Axis: Network connection (local)

Local NATS (loopback `:4222`, monitor `:8222`, JetStream on), the per-node stream
`local-events-<NODE_ID>`, and the daemon's connection to it. Acceptance proves messages **flow**, not
that a server is listening.

| ID | Proves | Method | PASS threshold | Evidence | Builds on |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NET-L0-1 | NATS service installed | `launchctl list ai.openclaw.nats` → PID | PID present | PID | 7.1 |
| NET-L1-1 | port listening | TCP connect `:4222` | connects | socket ok | 7.1 |
| NET-L1-2 | monitor healthy | `GET :8222/healthz` | HTTP 200 | body | health-check `checkNats` |
| NET-L1-3 | **JetStream enabled** | `GET :8222/jsz` | returns JS stats (api level, limits) | jsz JSON | 7.1 |
| NET-L1-4 | per-node stream exists | stream info for `local-events-<NODE_ID>` | stream present, subjects `local.>` | stream config | 1.7 |
| NET-L2-1 | **core pub/sub round-trip** | subscribe a probe subject, publish a nonce, await delivery | message received within 1s, payload matches | sent/received nonce + ms | nats-resolve |
| NET-L2-2 | **JetStream durability** | publish a nonce to the stream, read it back via consumer | the published message is read back intact | seq + payload | 1.7 done-criterion |
| NET-L2-3 | daemon connected | grep daemon log for `NATS connected` + stream-init line at boot | both lines present, current boot | log lines + ts | 0.4 |
| NET-L2-4 | **extraction trigger round-trip** | publish `mesh.memory.extract_request`; watch for a flush boundary (log/event) | a flush fires within `N` s | trigger→flush log pair | 1.6 done-criterion |
| NET-L1-5 | mesh services loaded | `launchctl list` for the 5 `mesh-*` jobs | all loaded | launchctl rows | 4.1 |

> NET-L2-1/L2-2 distinguish "server up" (L1) from "messaging works" (L2). NET-L2-4 is the
> network×memory cross-probe: it proves the *wire actually drives the pipeline*, which is the only thing
> that ever exercised real-time extraction (1.6 notes the idle timer is otherwise the sole path).

---

## 7. The harness

### 7.1 Contract

```
bin/node-acceptance.mjs [--profile single-node|federated] [--axis <axis>] [--json] [--report <path>] [--quiet]
```

- Default profile `single-node`. `--axis` runs one axis; otherwise all in-profile axes.
- Each check is a pure async fn returning
  `{ id, layer, axis, status, required, threshold, evidence, detail, latency_ms }`.
- Runs all layers (no early abort), then computes the §3 gate.
- Exit `0` accepted · `1` rejected.
- **Reality-first (§4.5):** every value is re-probed live. The harness trusts no doc, including this one
  and COMPONENT_REGISTRY.
- **Composition, not duplication:** reuses `lib/health-check.mjs` for L1 liveness, `ollama-queue`
  snapshot for LLM-L2-4, `node-identity` for L3 (future), `spawn-node` for the `federated` peer.

### 7.2 Output

Human table (default) + `--json` machine object. Always writes a dated report to
`~/.openclaw/.node-acceptance.md` (sibling of `.daemon-health.md`) and `--report` if given. The report
embeds the captured evidence verbatim — it **is** the §5 runtime-evidence artifact for a deploy.

```
Node Acceptance — node=daedalus profile=single-node — 2026-06-15T18:22:04Z
  L0 Presence   ████████  8/8   PASS
  L1 Liveness   ███████░  7/8   FAIL (companion-bridge :8787 down → MEM/E2E-L4-2 SKIP)
  L2 Functional ████████ 14/14  PASS
  L3 Inter-node  —  N/A (deferred this round)
  L4 End-to-end ███████░  1/2   PASS (gold round-trip MEM-L4-1 ✓; bridge e2e SKIP)
GATE: REJECTED — 1 FAIL. Evidence → ~/.openclaw/.node-acceptance.md
```

### 7.3 Determinism + safety

- Mutating memory probes require a separate daemon and state DB; the gold round-trip additionally requires a separate inject server and bus. `bin/run-memory-fixture.mjs` creates these under a mode-0700 temporary HOME and stops its children on exit. It uses the installed `nats-server`, project dependencies and the local Ollama service. Its report and logs remain in the printed fixture path. The launcher sets `OPENCLAW_HOME=$HOME/.openclaw`, `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE=$OPENCLAW_HOME/workspace`, `ACCEPT_ISOLATED_MEMORY=1`, `--axis memory`, a distinct `OPENCLAW_NATS_TOKEN` and `OPENCLAW_NODE_ID`, and dedicated high loopback bus/monitor and inject ports. `ACCEPTANCE_FIXTURE` is JSON with `{"type":"node-readiness-memory-fixture-v1","natsServerName":"acc-<unique-name>"}`. The fixture `openclaw.env` names that bus URL and token; its `config/daemon.json` contains only fixture-local workspace and scalar settings. The guard rejects paths or database hardlinks overlapping live state, transcript sources watched by the live daemon, copied live bus credentials, and a bus whose server identity/topology or monitor connection list does not match the marker and fixture daemon. The daemon verifies the private bus before its first subscription or JetStream call and disables reconnect in fixture mode. The authenticated inject server reports the daemon's own resolved script, HOME, workspace, DB, vault, model cache and registry paths and current bus identity; the gold probe refuses if any write path leaves the fixture. Reports are marked FIXTURE and stay inside the fixture home. A fresh initialized database plus verified daemon, bus and inject server are required before the round-trip can count as runtime evidence. Run the fixture while live Ollama extraction is idle.
- The LLM extraction probe uses a new synthetic session with no known-memory candidates. A green result proves generation of a nonce-linked SQLite decision; it does not prove typed references or supersession against existing memories. Those require a seeded fixture test.
- Direct ingest and the gold round-trip use different session IDs and nonces. The former checks the session-store API; only the daemon can create the latter's store and index rows. The gold probe waits for both rows before retrieving, so a direct import or a snippet repeating the decision cannot make it pass.
- The required watcher probe runs after the gold and inject probes. It rejects a watcher alert or a gold session that needed an extraction retry; an idempotent no-op after a successful extraction does not count as a failed attempt. The fixture's one-second synthesis cadence is a stress setting, not a production latency claim.
- Native Ollama streaming has a 600-second owned request budget, but Node's HTTP client may time out waiting for the first response headers after about 300 seconds. A cold or overloaded model can therefore fail before the first token; record that separately from mid-stream completion.
- Idempotent: a second run produces the same verdicts (modulo real drift).
- Read-mostly: the only writes are the synthetic session JSONL, its derived rows, a probe NATS message,
  and the report file.

### 7.4 Teardown

Always-run cleanup (even on failure): delete synthetic JSONL and session rows, clear any decision
supersession pointer to a synthetic decision, and remove nonce aliases and run-owned edges. A cleanup
failure rejects acceptance. Durable event-log writes and updates to shared themes cannot be rolled back
by this cleanup; the gold probe must run in an isolated fixture.

---

## 8. Inter-node reliability — L3 (DEFERRED this round; contract for the next)

Federation is `ABSENT` in the live runtime, so these are specified, not built, and report `N/A (deferred)`
on `single-node`. They activate under `--profile federated`, validated against a `bin/spawn-node.mjs`
peer on one machine or a real second node. This honors the original "be thorough about other-node
reliability" intent by leaving the next round a complete contract; it does **not** authorize build now.

| ID | Proves | Method | PASS threshold | Builds on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NODE-1 | identity | each node has ed25519 `identity.{key,pub}`; `identity-registry.json` lists the peer | signature verify succeeds for a trusted peer | node-identity, 1.5 |
| NODE-2 | **broadcast→offer→accept** | node A broadcasts a context theme; B offers; A accepts | a `[peer-memory:]` block surfaces in A's next injection | broadcast-emitter/offerer/acceptor, 1.5 done-criterion |
| NODE-3 | signature enforcement | inject an unsigned/forged broadcast | it is **rejected**, not surfaced | broadcast-schemas, federation-startup |
| NODE-4 | replay dedup | resend a broadcast with a seen event id | ignored (seenIds cache) | `createSeenEventCache` |
| NODE-5 | **resilience to peer drop** | kill peer B mid-exchange | A degrades gracefully (no crash, local-first continues) then reconnects when B returns | federation-resilience, heartbeat-detect |
| NODE-6 | heartbeat/liveness | each node observes the other's heartbeat | dead-node detection fires when a peer drops | heartbeat-detect |
| NODE-7 | **partition / offline tolerance** | make *all* peers unreachable | full local function continues (local-first guarantee) | MASTER_PLAN 3.2 local-first |

Observability for these already exists: `bin/dogfood-council.mjs` (docs/DOGFOOD_PROTOCOL.md) subscribes to
the federation subjects and records round-trips — the L3 harness should *drive* the exchange and let the
dogfood harness *witness* it. Cluster/peer setup: docs/MULTI_NODE_DEPLOY.md, docs/NATS_CLUSTER.md.

---

## 9. End-to-end — L4

| ID | Proves | Method | PASS threshold | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E2E-L4-1 | memory loop closes | = MEM-L4-1 gold round-trip | nonce-linked SQLite decision persisted and retrieved | the deployable single-node e2e |
| E2E-L4-2 | harness→LLM injection | with companion-bridge `:8787` up, send a prompt; inspect the upstream request | a memory block is present in the request to the LLM | `SKIP` while bridge is `INERT` (2.1); conditional |

E2E-L4-2 depends on companion-bridge running as a daemon, which it currently is not (COMPONENT_REGISTRY
2.1). Until it is, the gold round-trip (E2E-L4-1) is the binding end-to-end acceptance.

---

## 10. How it enforces "100%"

This protocol has teeth only if a deploy is *not done* until the gate is green:

1. **Manual gate** — `node bin/node-acceptance.mjs` after any deploy/restart. Non-zero exit = not done.
2. **Deploy-listener gate** — the mesh deploy path (`mesh-deploy-listener`) runs the harness post-restart;
   a red gate refuses to mark the deploy complete and alerts via the existing `health-watch` channels.
3. **Done-contract binding** — the harness report at `~/.openclaw/.node-acceptance.md` is the
   `Runtime-Evidence:` artifact (MASTER_PLAN §5.4) any node-touching step cites.
4. **Continuous** — optionally schedule the harness (cron / launchd) so acceptance is re-verified, not
   assumed; it complements `health-watch` (liveness, 60 s) with deep functional acceptance (e.g. hourly).

It does **not** replace the unit suite (correctness) or `health-watch` (liveness) — it sits above both as
the deployed-node truth gate.

---

## 11. Proposed build plan (after operator review)

Each step is atomic, runtime-verifiable, and maps to a layer — suitable as a `node-acceptance` plan silo
(`new-plan.sh`) or a single scoped feature, operator's call:

1. **Harness skeleton** — `bin/node-acceptance.mjs` runner, verdict/report types, gate computation,
   `--json`/report writer; wire L1 by delegating to `runHealthCheck`. *Verify:* runs, reports L1, exit code reflects gate.
2. **L0 presence** — deploy-surface probes (files, symlinks, `diff -rq`, plists, token perms). *Verify:* a deliberately-removed symlink flips MEM-L0 red.
3. **Network axis (L1/L2)** — NATS port/monitor/jsz/stream, pub/sub + JetStream round-trip, trigger round-trip. *Verify:* round-trip nonce echoed; stopping NATS flips it red.
4. **LLM axis** — model-present, generation, embedding, structured-extraction, queue. *Verify:* real generation text + 1024-dim vector captured.
5. **Memory axis incl. gold round-trip** — synthetic ingest→extract→persist decision→index→inject, MEM-L4-1, teardown. *Verify:* the SQLite decision is stored and retrieved for the nonce project; fixtures gone after.
6. **Enforcement wiring** — deploy-listener hook + optional schedule + done-contract reference. *Verify:* a red gate blocks deploy-complete.

L3 (§8) is a **separate future block**, gated on federation being deployed.

---

## 12. Open decisions for the operator

- **D1** — Build vehicle: a dedicated `node-acceptance` **plan silo** (full protocol/tick/viewer treatment)
  vs a **single scoped feature** (`bin/node-acceptance.mjs` + this doc). (You chose design-doc-first; this
  is the next fork.)
- **D2** — Should a red acceptance gate *hard-block* the `mesh-deploy-listener`, or only warn? (§10.2)
- **D3** — Generation latency budget (`ACCEPT_GEN_BUDGET_MS`) default — 30 s tolerates cold model load;
  too loose to catch a degraded GPU. Set per-hardware?
- **D4** — Schedule cadence for continuous acceptance (§10.4), or manual/CI only?
