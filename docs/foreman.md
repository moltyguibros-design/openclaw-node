# Foreman — deterministic supervision over mesh workers

`lib/foreman/` watches a mesh worker while it works and acts on what it sees. It is the
supervisory design of [thruwire/foreman](https://github.com/thruwire/foreman) — reviewed
2026-09-19, its policy defects fixed — landed inside `bin/mesh-agent.js`, where the worker's output
stream, task worktree and lifecycle already live. Plan: `memory-plan/plans/foreman/` (DECISIONS
D1, D2).

```

## What it watches

Each observation is compact and bounded — never the repository:

- the task (title, description, metric, scope, budget) and factory status;
- the active worker's stdout/stderr tails (8k chars each) and the worker history;
- `git status --short`, a bounded diff (12k) and changed file names from the task worktree;
- the worktree's own `AGENTS.override.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` (6k, read fresh, never persisted);
- the metric result once it ran (this pipeline's verification signal);
- the previous assessment and decision, attempt/failure counts, elapsed time.

## What it assesses

Ten independent yes/no questions, each answered with the probability of "yes". Five describe the
**task**: `implementation_complete`, `tests_sufficient`, `requirements_satisfied`,
`needs_verification`, `ready_to_finish`. Five describe the **floor now**: `meaningful_progress`,
`worker_stuck`, `work_off_track`, `agents_md_drift`, `needs_human`. A missing dimension is an
error, never a default.

The assessor is the local model through the existing analysis lane (`lib/llm-client.mjs`
`generateAnalysis`, 8s ceiling, small output). **If it is unavailable — busy with extraction,
down, or answering junk — the cycle is a passthrough: no decision, and the worker runs exactly as
it does today.** Foreman escalates in that case; here the metric, harness and review gates are
still downstream, so killing healthy work over a model outage would be strictly worse.

## What it decides

A deterministic policy (`lib/foreman/policy.mjs`), in this precedence:

1. `needs_human` ≥ 0.80 → **ESCALATE**
2. intervention ceiling (20 actions other than CONTINUE — never a count of assessments) → **ESCALATE**
3. active worker off track / drifting / stuck ≥ 0.80 → **STEER_WORKER** if the worker has a live
   input channel and budget remains (a rejected delivery is retried, not charged); otherwise
   **STOP_WORKER**; a delivered steer buys a 30s grace period
4. no active worker after a stop → **RETRY_WORKER** (once), then **ESCALATE**
5. ready ≥ 0.75, requirements ≥ 0.75, tests ≥ 0.75, and verification resolved → **FINISH** —
   only a verifier that ran *after* the latest coding pass and **passed** resolves it (or
   `needs_verification` < 0.65)
6. implementation ≥ 0.75 and `needs_verification` ≥ 0.65 → **START_VERIFIER**
7. no active worker → **START_WORKER**; else **CONTINUE**

`claude -p` has no live input channel, so `supports_steering` is false and step 3 resolves to
STOP.

## What it does about it

| Decision | While the worker runs | After the worker exits (no metric) | After the worker exits (metric) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **STOP_WORKER** | SIGTERM the worker's whole process group, SIGKILL after `MESH_FOREMAN_STOP_GRACE_MS`; the agent's attempt loop retries with `stopped by Foreman — <reason>` and the steering guidance in the retry prompt | — | — |
| **ESCALATE** | same termination, then the loop stops spending attempts and releases the task for human triage with the reason | release instead of completing | advisory — a passed metric wins |
| **START_VERIFIER** | — | an independent verification worker runs with a read-only mission; `FOREMAN_VERDICT: FAIL` (or no verdict) records a failed attempt with the findings and retries; `PASS` completes | — (the metric is the verification) |
| **RETRY_WORKER / START_WORKER / FINISH / CONTINUE** | advisory: the agent's loop already owns starting, retrying and completing | | |

The worker leads its own process group (`detached: true` in `runLLM`) so a stop ends the CLI and
everything it spawned. The retry prompt already renders every attempt's approach and result, so
the next attempt reads exactly why the last one was stopped and what to change.

## Modes

| Mode | Default | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| **enforce** | yes | Decisions act as in the table above, and are recorded. |
| **shadow** | `MESH_FOREMAN_ENFORCE=0` | Every assessment and decision is recorded; nothing is enforced. |
| off | `MESH_FOREMAN=0` | No supervisor is created. |

## The timeline

One JSONL file per task at `~/.openclaw/foreman/<task_id>.jsonl` (`MESH_FOREMAN_DIR`):
`foreman.started` · `worker.started` · `foreman.observed` · `foreman.assessed` ·
`foreman.intervened` (with `mode` and, when enforced, `outcome`) · `foreman.assessor_unavailable` ·
`worker.exited` · `verification.recorded` · `foreman.closed` (the summary). Worker output feeds the
observation in memory and is **never** written per line. `foreman.assessed`, `foreman.intervened`,
`foreman.assessor_unavailable` and `foreman.closed` are also published on the bus as
`mesh.foreman.<event>` with `task_id` and `node_id`.

The task's hyperagent telemetry row carries a one-line summary in `meta_notes`:
`Foreman[shadow] iterations=N interventions=N actions=CONTINUE:n,… assessor=llm:qwen3:8b failures=0 last(progress=… stuck=… ready=…)`.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `MESH_FOREMAN` | `1` | `0` disables supervision |
| `MESH_FOREMAN_ENFORCE` | `1` | `0` records decisions without acting (shadow) |
| `MESH_FOREMAN_STOP_GRACE_MS` | `5000` | SIGTERM → SIGKILL grace when stopping a worker |
| `MESH_FOREMAN_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` | `5000` | debounce floor between assessments while output flows |
| `MESH_FOREMAN_PERIODIC_MS` | `30000` | assessment during quiet work |
| `MESH_FOREMAN_ASSESS_TIMEOUT_MS` | `8000` | analysis-lane ceiling before passthrough |
| `MESH_FOREMAN_MODEL` | `LLM_MODEL` | assessor model (Ollama tag) |
| `MESH_FOREMAN_DIR` | `~/.openclaw/foreman` | timeline directory |
| `MESH_FOREMAN_MAX_INTERVENTIONS` | `20` | ceiling on actions other than CONTINUE |
| `MESH_FOREMAN_MAX_RETRIES` | `MESH_MAX_ATTEMPTS − 1` | retries after a stop (the agent's own attempt loop is the real budget) |
| `MESH_FOREMAN_MAX_WORKERS` | `2 × MESH_MAX_ATTEMPTS + 2` | worker records per task: one coding worker plus one metric verification record per attempt |
| `MESH_FOREMAN_GRACE_MS` | `30000` | post-steer grace |

Thresholds and observation bounds are fields of `DEFAULT_POLICY` / `DEFAULT_LIMITS` for embedders.

## Tests

`node --test test/foreman-*.test.mjs` — offline: every policy branch (including the three
fixes above), the strict assessment contract, git evidence in a real temp repository, the
assessor against a stub analysis lane (llm / fallback / error / rejected), the supervisor loop
against fake streams and a **real spawned child process**, and enforcement against **real detached
children**: a stuck worker's process group terminated with SIGTERM, the SIGKILL fallback when it
ignores SIGTERM, ESCALATE raising the release, shadow mode leaving the worker alone, and the
verifier's verdict contract.
