# Node state recovery — inventory

| Block | Step | Version | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1.1 | v1.1 | [x] | Establish verified application SQLite recovery snapshots |
| 1 | 1.2 | v1.2 | [A] | Establish verified JetStream history recovery snapshots |
| 1 | 1.3 | v1.3 | [ ] | Establish a coordinated application and bus recovery point |

> **1.1 — Goal:** Establish verified application SQLite recovery snapshots.
> **Needs:** Twelve application stores enumerated; SQLite backup API and installed sqlite-vec available; private backup storage with sufficient space.
> **Feeds:** Node-readiness 1.3 and later storage/capture repair.
> **Verify:** runtime/code: Read-only source transactions feed SQLite's backup API; offline restores pass integrity_check with identical schema, user_version, per-table row counts and content digests. Services stay running; no application initialization or source repair. Backup/restore directories 0700 and files 0600.

Closed 2026-09-28: twelve stores / 116 physical tables restored with matching fingerprints, six native FTS checks and eight vector probes; private deployed tools; unchanged service PIDs/runs; green isolated CI and Claude Message 68 acceptance. See step11_sqlite/AUDIT_POST.md. Individual points only; parent 1.3 remains open.

> **1.2 — Goal:** Establish verified JetStream history recovery snapshots.
> **Needs:** Four distinct store directories and four configurations inventoried; offline R=1 directories intact; installed NATS CLI/server available; independent review of snapshot/restore sequence.
> **Feeds:** Node-readiness 1.3 and topology 1.4.
> **Verify:** runtime/code: Reachable streams snapshot/restore on isolated loopback servers; stopped-server copies preserve all four stores including unavailable R=1 streams. Restored counts, messages and last sequences match captured originals, with explicit treatment of expiring health streams. No isolated server routes to production; histories remain separate.

In flight 2026-09-28 21:33 EDT: offline member-1 master/restore and eleven online archives accepted; revised owned recovery/admission tests pass after a retained refused run. Lifecycle prerequisite repairs are merged. Crash recovery did not close this step. Durable intent and account-group observations now have owned fault/election evidence. A managed driver with real stop gates, the three healthy cold masters, their isolated restores and truthful service resumption are still required. Full-baseline restoration, a shared node lock/unresolved fence and an immutable sealing mechanism now have owned evidence. The detached managed driver, actual unit/process identity bindings, real stop controls and degraded-history resolution procedure remain pending. A fixed persistent parent, complete explicit inventory and recoverable receipts now have owned fault evidence; Claude review of the new patch is pending. See step12_jetstream/RUNTIME_EVIDENCE.md and D7–D10.

Third-round checkpoint 2026-09-28 23:49 EDT: Claude accepted bbbc883's eight fixes and lineage; exact CI36516935187 is green. Its new creation-interruption and static-identity findings have source/deployed53-test evidence. Setup now prepares the full receipt before mkdir and reopens restore-only; Finder metadata is explicit. Exact new CI/review and the managed driver/healthy cold masters remain pending. See D11.

Fourth-round checkpoint 2026-09-29 00:58 EDT: ab7097c exact CI36518928261
is green; Claude accepted N1/N2 and identified owned regular Finder metadata
inside an initializing root. tools-v31 passes55 fresh tests, old source fails
the added recovery regression, and invalid metadata remains fenced. Main
55131b8's verified readiness prerequisite is integrated before fresh CI. This
checkpoint remains1.2[A]/v1.2-pre; managed driver/cold masters still pending.
See D12 and FINDER_SETUP_EVIDENCE.json.

Managed-stop checkpoint 2026-09-29 01:11 EDT: tools-v33 passes six actual
owned Mac controls and eleven read-only owner bindings. The obsolete private
driver is retired without service operations. Source N3 checkpoint0b96e93
has green exact CI and Claude Message38 acceptance. Stop-adapter CI/review
and the complete detached production orchestration remain pending;1.2 stays[A].
See D13 and MANAGED_STOP_EVIDENCE.json.

Fixture checkpoint 2026-09-29 01:21 EDT: tools-v36 passes the complete owned
recovery suite after tightening its placement cohort gate; an actual missing
member refuses. Prior f3bb44f CI failed before the Mac adapter ran; exact new
CI/review required.1.2 remains[A]; no production cold-copy acceptance.

> **1.3 — Goal:** Establish a coordinated application and bus recovery point.
> **Needs:** 1.1 and 1.2 recovery mechanisms verified; all writers and their service ownership identified; inventory ENOENT robustness addressed; primary/derived file sources, configs and browser-profile policy enumerated; quiescence/restart sequence independently challenged.
> **Feeds:** Node-readiness 1.3, then topology repair 1.4.
> **Verify:** runtime/code: With application and bus writers quiesced, take one final application/JetStream recovery set, including or explicitly excluding each non-SQLite canonical source; record its common quiet window, cursor/consumer states and hashes. Prove isolated recovery while keeping original owners/configuration/history intact; all services resume their prior state. Do not resume task execution from a mismatched set.

### Source foundation checkpoint — 2026-09-29 07:12:37 EDT

PR144 now targets the reviewed recovery tools, not completion of1.2. The
1.2 row remains[A] and VERSION remainsv1.2-pre. Exact integration CI and
Claude review are pending at this checkpoint. All existing forensic evidence
is retained as tool-development history; merging source enables no live hold.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 00:01 EDT: the actual on-demand mesh-agent state exposed
a full-node baseline refusal. D21 records the strict class correction and the
known-broken classification fence. A read-only 20-unit structural capture now
passes with 54 direct file pins; 65 Journal and 27 owned Mac recovery tests
pass. Complete dependency/provenance pins, production controller, three healthy
cold masters, isolated restores and truthful resumption remain open at
1.2[A]/v1.2-pre. See step12_jetstream/RUNTIME_EVIDENCE.md.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 13:40 EDT, amending the 00:01 capture above (foreman
PR #174, operator-approved): `ai.openclaw.mesh-agent` was re-pointed to the
layered release `~/.openclaw/releases/worker-drain-69b7f37-foreman-5cb71b7-e57f89b`,
which is worker-drain-69b7f37-e57f89b plus `lib/foreman/supervisor.mjs` (see
its LIFECYCLE_PROVENANCE.json). Only `ProgramArguments[1]` changed. The plist
sha256 went from bb28366cfa6abde712e89dd84c5d0e725a1557cc2eec6ad024f321375d535de5
to c9209b9b66ffde255061c790d3c9fa62fffa46fbe7e60357f6472258af578d0c. Unchanged:
entry SHA 1304cb31…, environment, KeepAlive/RunAtLoad false, the `node_modules`
link and bare-module resolutions. The unit is still loaded, not running and not
disabled (D21 on-demand). The 00:01 capture's mesh-agent pins are stale:
recapture the full-node baseline before the first full-node journal. Rollback:
restore `~/.openclaw/backups/foreman/ai.openclaw.mesh-agent.plist.20261001T134005.bak`,
then bootout and bootstrap; the old release is untouched.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 01:29 EDT: D22 widens the draft full-node source cohort
to 23 and adds a strict durable scope plus a multi-domain entrypoint preflight.
The live read-only preflight refuses two additional loaded system jobs; the
legacy root agent is crash-looping and cannot be retired without administrator
access. The gateway/viewer stop and detached-process fence, passive network
helper exclusion, complete dependency pins, protected-controller handoff,
healthy cold masters, isolated restores and truthful service resumption remain
open. No production preservation window started; 1.2 remains [A] at v1.2-pre.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 01:55 EDT: Claude's exact b0669c7 challenge found an
unscoped 23-unit journal and neutral-label loaded-job omissions. D23's source
correction requires explicit new-window scope, binds the multi-domain inventory
to the full-node journal, and restores the deploy listener last. Owned tests and
new exact CI/review are required. The live widened scan still refuses the two
system jobs; the driver, cold masters and production restoration remain open.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 02:29:15 EDT: the bounded PR #169 source now carries
Claude's d7fc991 follow-up corrections. Relative/wrapper and hard-linked
argument jobs are classified, recovery continues restoring known units after
inventory drift without certifying, and full-node sealing refuses until a
continuous launchd/process watch exists. The current read-only scan takes
4.75 seconds and still refuses the same two root-managed system jobs. The
controller, privileged job disposition, healthy cold masters, isolated
restores and verified production resumption remain open at 1.2[A]/v1.2-pre.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 12:29 EDT: D24 defines the separate protected-writer
migration boundary. A source-only guard refuses ordinary install/auth-sync
paths once the future root-owned handoff marker exists. It has no effect on the
current live bus, where no marker has been created. Root migration journal,
old GUI job retirement, protected service UID/volume, credential lifecycle,
system-domain probes and healthy cold masters remain open; 1.2 stays [A].

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 12:41 EDT: D25 adds the reachable `openclaw-stack up`
refusal and keeps auth fixture tests runnable after a host marker is published.
The separate root migration, protected credential publisher, system-domain
monitoring and production recovery evidence remain open at 1.2[A].

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 12:43 EDT: D26 defines the marker directory mode,
pre-commit rollback removal order, and installer rechecks at NATS write
boundaries. The future root migration must also exclude installers already in
flight; the source rechecks alone are not a cross-process lock.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 12:55 EDT: D27 adds a system-domain NATS watcher path
under the fixed handoff marker. This Mac's active labels are `nats`, `nats-2`,
`nats-3`; historical `nats-1` must remain unloaded. A 0600 node-local cohort
file records that layout; fresh installs create the singleton declaration,
while missing declarations report UNKNOWN. The future root marker must pin
its active cohort. GUI
and user-domain known-label duplicates refuse. Owned tests cover both
layouts, legacy/protected domains and invalid markers. A read-only live probe
of the no-marker branch observed all five core PIDs with no loaded known
duplicates. This does not exercise a protected system job. Claude's review of
e9b17e6 found no source blocker within PID-liveness scope and identified the
portable-layout correction. Claude's a96251c delta review then reproduced a
missing-file false WORKING during partial bootout; the declaration is now
mandatory, initialized only for fresh singleton installs. Focused owned tests
pass; exact new CI and review are pending. Root
migration and three healthy cold masters remain open at 1.2[A].

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 13:18 EDT: D28's read-only `/routez` + `/jsz` audit
confirms standalone 4222 and a separate two-member 4223/4224 cluster.
The owned topology classifier passes four fixture controls; the live
`--expect standalone-plus-two` control passes and
`--expect three-member-cluster` exits 1. The protected handoff must preserve these
distinct histories before any repair. No service, store or marker changed;
root migration, three healthy cold masters and complete restoration remain
open at 1.2[A]/v1.2-pre.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 13:20 EDT: D29's read-only protected-site audit
passes its owned controls and refuses staging on the live host because
`_openclaw_nats` and `/private/var/db/openclaw-nats` are absent. APFS ownership
and the root-controlled parent pass. The audit is not cutover authorization;
no account, directory, service or store changed. Privileged staging and the
root migration journal remain required before a protected writer can start.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 13:33 EDT: D30 extends that audit to every protected
ancestor and refuses a handoff root on a different device. The refreshed
`SITE_STATIC_EVIDENCE.json` passes the ancestor-chain check; the account and
root remain absent. Focused controls pass 69/69. No privileged mutation or
writer cutover occurred.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 13:47 EDT: D31 closes Claude's PR #175 staging-account
blocker in source and retains the offline third Raft peer in the topology
evidence. The audit now checks the account's dedicated identity, ACL absence,
the monitor-to-client port binding and the shared marker path. The live site
still refuses: `_openclaw_nats` and the protected root are absent. Root
migration, account creation, the three healthy cold masters and restoration proof
remain open at 1.2[A]/v1.2-pre.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 13:55 EDT: D32 narrows the offline-replica claim to
one live peer's observation; the leader is not pinned by the saved snapshot.
The separately held member-1 store and three healthy cold masters retain
their independent preservation requirements.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 14:03 EDT: D33 hardens the read-only site audit's
macOS parsing after adversarial review. ACL entries are read even when `ls`
shows `@`, and a valid `dseditgroup` non-membership result is accepted despite
exit 67. The live protected site is still not staged; no writer changed.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 14:09 EDT: D34 requires exclusive service UID/GID
directory records, an empty dedicated group and a narrow supplemental-group
set before staging. The root account/directory, migration journal and cold
masters remain absent; no production writer changed.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 14:15 EDT: D35 requires converged three-member
metadata before the audit can label a fully routed graph a three-member
cluster. The saved evidence is now a reproducible CLI projection with a
hashed unresolved peer ID. The live split topology is unchanged; this is
read-only observation, not a cold-master or cutover acceptance.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 14:25 EDT: D36 closes two more protected-account
false-ready cases: an operator whose primary or supplemental group is the
service GID, and GUID-only `GroupMembers` membership. A follow-up search
requires no other user's primary GID to match the service group, including a
space-bearing directory record name. The live account and protected root
remain absent; no writer cutover occurred.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 14:29 EDT: D37 records server names, metadata leaders
and `/varz` start times in reproducible public evidence. The current read-only
`standalone-plus-two` control passes, the three-member expectation exits 1,
and the three live process start times are unchanged. This is an election
observation, not cold-master or restoration acceptance. Exact CI and Claude
delta review remain pending for this head.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 14:38 EDT: D38 makes the read-only staging audit refuse
a protected root with any leftover entry. This closes an older false-ready
case without touching the live node; its root and dedicated account remain
absent. Focused tests and exact-head CI/review must pass before merging the
preflight source. UID/GID stale-file search across the data volume remains a
separate account-provisioning requirement, not evidence from this audit.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 15:03 EDT: PR #175's read-only preflight merged with
exact-head CI green on rerun and Claude's no-blocker review. The active watcher
was separately switched to the already-merged PR #173 cohort code and reports
the actual `nats`, `nats-2`, `nats-3` layout as WORKING. D39 records four
root-migration design blockers and a revised review candidate. No root
transaction, protected account/marker, cold masters, isolated restores or
cutover exists; step 1.2 remains [A] at v1.2-pre.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 15:17 EDT: D40 adds the shared-lock prerequisite to
legacy installer, uninstaller, auth-render, trust-peer sync, cohort init and
stack control source. Private lock fixtures prove shared child lifetime,
exclusive contention, marker refusal and invalid-file refusal. The macOS CI
job exercises the descriptor handoff and background-child release; relevant
source tests pass. The root-owned lock has not been created, and the existing production
entrypoints have not been redeployed from this candidate. Root journal,
durable user-to-root transfer, client hold and cutover remain open at 1.2[A].

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 16:02 EDT: PR #177 merged with four green CI jobs and
Claude's no-blocker review. The new root-side exclusion primitive and macOS
fixtures are being prepared separately. No live lock file exists yet; merged
legacy source is not evidence that installed old copies have been replaced.
The root journal, preservation transfer, client disable, cold masters and
protected bootstrap remain open at 1.2[A]/v1.2-pre.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 16:16 EDT: draft PR #178 now includes a source-only root
lock bootstrap journal: intent-before-create, exclusive lock, old-writer
census callback, and admission readback under exclusion. Local private
fixtures pass (root lock 14/14, journal 17/17). The callbacks do not yet have a
production pinned root driver; no marker, service, store or root-owned path
was changed. Claude's exact-head review requires pre-receipt lock identity
pinning, empty/pending-record reentry and a terminal reboot/abandonment path
before this journal can control a live migration. The production path now
refuses in code until those are implemented. Durable preservation transfer,
physical census implementation, cold masters and cutover remain open at
1.2[A]/v1.2-pre.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 17:11 EDT: a source-only follow-up to PR #178 now
prototypes a single locked ledger outside the protected site and stages the
shared lock under a transaction-specific name before linking it into view.
Private tests cover an empty ledger, interrupted pending records, concurrent
drivers, a two-link interruption, same-inode restart, deletion before the
admission receipt, and replacement after it. The production root path remains
gated. This does not yet implement terminal abandonment, reboot successors,
user-journal transfer, marker/rollback states, physical census or the
protected NATS driver. No live root path or NATS process was changed; step
1.2 remains [A] at v1.2-pre.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 17:44 EDT: after PR #179 merged, a new source-only
branch adds a durable pre-marker `returned` outcome, a public readback receipt
and successor transactions. A successor inherits the same lock inode, nonce
and change time; once `lock-staged` was recorded, return relinks the recorded
inode instead of dropping its last name. Intent-only unpublished stage may be
discarded. Returning takes exclusive exclusion, so a live shared holder
refuses. Private Mac fixtures passed 49/49 across journal and root-lock tests,
including marker refusal, tampered outcome, reboot return and repeated
successors. The real macOS-root path remains gated. Physical release/admission
checks, durable user transfer, marker/rollback states, the protected driver,
cold masters and live deployment remain open at 1.2[A]/v1.2-pre.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 17:55 EDT: Claude's exact-head review of draft PR #180
at 970ab8c confirmed same-inode relink and all four CI jobs, and found two
fail-closed ledger wedges: a reused transaction ID, and an empty intent-only
stage after interrupted creation. A local revision refuses reuse before
append, permits only a one-link nonce-prefix unpublished stage to be removed,
binds forward admission to the current boot, matches the user journal's boot
hash format, and creates the public outcome directory at its fixed mode under
a restrictive umask. Focused Mac tests pass 59/59. The revision needs a new
exact-head CI and Claude review; live state is unchanged and 1.2 remains [A].

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 18:16 EDT: PR #180 merged at e918a3e with 4/4 CI,
Claude's no-blocker exact-head review, and 59/59 local Mac root-lock fixtures.
The new user-transfer source branch records a full-node NATS transfer intent
and freezes its journal until an owner-checked, exact-binding root `returned`
receipt closes it. Returned windows remain restore-only. Local tests pass
112/112 for the user journal and hold, 59/59 for the root journal and lock.
This is source-only: root `declined`, post-marker `rolled-back`, and `accepted`
outcomes, physical user-journal validation in the root driver, root service
admission/census, protected marker/rollback, cold masters and live cutover are
still open. The production macOS-root path remains gated; no live service or
protected store was changed. Step 1.2 remains [A] at v1.2-pre.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 18:30 EDT: Claude's exact-head read-only review of
PR #181 at d0eafbc reproduced the user (112 tests) and root (45 tests)
suites and found a blocking unclosable transfer when no root transaction ever
began. The branch now gates the production transfer entrypoint until `declined`
and root validation exist. Returned legacy NATS restoration additionally checks
the marker and shares the root writer lock around each mutation, while any
transfer ends the original hold's same-process forward certification. New
focused controls cover the production gate, shared-lock exclusion and hold
certification. Exact-head CI/review remain pending for this revision; no live
root or NATS state was changed. Step 1.2 remains [A] at v1.2-pre.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 18:46 EDT: a dependent source branch adds a read-only
root validator for the owner-private user transfer. It holds the node and
journal locks, pins the journal directory descriptor, verifies the chain,
full-node baseline, current boot, node receipt, original native hold and NATS
unload lineage, then rechecks the same transfer head. The user intent now
includes transfer-time hold evidence so the root can bind its hash and compare
the watch session to the original close without requiring volatile fields to
stay byte-identical. Five root-reader fixtures and 115 user/hold tests pass
locally. The root journal does not yet invoke this validator or durably pin
the two records. All production gates remain in place; 1.2 stays [A].

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 19:01 EDT: adversarial review of PR #182 found that
the real `close_and_drain` verifier records native hold evidence at the top
level; the first validator fixture incorrectly nested it. The validator and
fixture now use the producer's shape. Root recheck also detects replacement
of a held owner lock by comparing open and named inode/ctime identities. The
production root and transfer gates remain closed pending exact-head review.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 19:07 EDT: PR #182's adversarial review reproduced the
receipt-shape blocker with a real gate/hold chain. The revision now includes
that real macOS positive control, allows owner-owned Finder metadata, refuses
unknown forward-window events, and detects replacement of either held owner
lock. Local root/transfer suites pass 68/68 and user journal/hold 115/115.
The branch remains draft until revised-head CI and review pass.

Checkpoint 2026-10-01 19:15 EDT: Claude's exact-head review of 0006d8b
reported no blocker. Its two minor refusal cases are now closed: owner-owned
regular Finder metadata is allowed regardless of mode under the 0700 journal
directory, and deeply nested malformed JSON returns `Refused`. macOS CI now
runs the existing user journal and hold suites as well as the real-gate
validator test. Local focused tests remain 68/68; user/hold tests 115/115.
Revised CI is pending. Production gates remain closed.
