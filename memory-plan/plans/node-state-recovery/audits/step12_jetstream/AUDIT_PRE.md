# Step 1.2 — JetStream history recovery

## 0 — Micro Re-Orient
- Block 1 preserves histories before topology/storage repair.
- Step 1.1 delivered twelve verified per-store SQLite snapshots, merged PR #143.
- This step proves both split JetStream histories recover, including offline R1.
- It serves local-first durable memory and trustworthy optional federation.
- Yes: histories must survive before competing listeners are repaired.

## 1 — Needs and current evidence
Four distinct directories/configs were inventoried 2026-09-28 08:37 EDT.
Standalone has seven streams; cluster has six, two unavailable R1 on member 1.
Installed CLI 0.3.1 and server 2.12.6 are available. Claude Message 70 supplied
independent challenge before any service stop. Actual live units all name
/opt/homebrew/bin/nats-server, unlike template differences. At 08:56 EDT the
member-1 fatal line is monitor 8222 already in use: recovery has not opened its
store on that attempt. No prior stopped copy or topology change is claimed.

## 2 — Design
Use installed official CLI snapshots with consumers; never create ordered
consumers on production for digesting. Verify raw sequence, subject, exact
server timestamp, headers and payload via read-only message-get APIs on isolated
restores. Record snapshot metadata and consumer delivered/ack/pending state.
Owned fixtures cover deleted holes, binary payload/duplicate headers, pending
acks, TTL expiry, R1 offline-member recovery and route confinement.

After fixtures: boot out failing member 1, verify no owner, copy/fsync/hash its
intact store and config privately. Persistently disable it and verify print-disabled (D6). Take reachable online
CLI snapshots. Before the other cold copies, prove idle executors/leases, all
consumer ack-pending zero, all clients/timers quiesced and connz empty; stop
members 2/3 before standalone. Copy only after verified exit/clean shutdown.
Resume standalone and verify both 4222/8222 plus JetStream ready, then members
2/3, then original client/timer set. Never resume member 1 into contested ports.

All recovered servers use working copies; immutable private masters are never
opened. Generate configs with original names/global account, sufficient limits,
fresh unique loopback client/monitor/route ports, route credentials and
no_advertise. Verify routez/leafz/gatewayz and actual listeners. Start clone 2/3,
verify COLLAB/PLANS assignments, then clone 1; preserve offline originals even
if catch-up would discard a working copy. Snapshots restore into distinct empty
servers, never an existing-history clone. Record any R3->R1 isolated override.
Compare snapshot restore to cold clone at snapshot high-water mark, accounting
for retention changes explicitly; mismatch refuses acceptance. Health TTL
expiry is expected and separately recorded, never called restored liveness.

## 3 — Risk register
- Client fallback can cross histories: resolve URLs, drain timers, stop cluster
  before standalone; no application workers on clones.
- Stop timeout can force a crash: record signal/exit/log evidence; label crash
  consistency and do not claim clean shutdown without evidence.
- Stale metadata can delete R1 copies: protected masters + assignment check.
- Snapshot state differs from later stream info: use backup metadata and compare
  isolated contents, not a count taken at another time.
- TTL/consumer inactivity/redelivery can change state: fixtures and explicit
  treatment; drained production consumers have zero pending acknowledgements.
- Copies remain on this disk: logical rollback, not machine-loss protection.

## 4 — Verification
Focused owned fixtures only locally; isolated CI retains the existing suite.
Actual snapshots restore to independent instances with matching non-expiring
message digests/sequences/holes and durable positions. All four cold copies
carry path/config/binary/hash provenance. Sanitize public proof, keep payloads
and tokens only in 0700 directories / 0600 files. Inspect deployed tools.
No topology repair, history union, requeue, source deletion or application
initialization. Parent coordinated recovery remains open.

## 5 — Runtime landing
Private tools and immutable/working backup sets under
~/.openclaw/backups/node-readiness/jetstream-20260928-<run>/, consumed by child
1.3 and topology 1.4. Both plan tick chains remain unloaded.

## 6 — File deltas
- This audit directory: official CLI wrapper, digest verifier, focused fixtures,
  operational runbook and pre/post/runtime evidence.
- Plan inventory/version/registry/decisions: current carrier and verified state.
- .github/workflows/test.yml: run isolated recovery fixtures with pinned tools.
- No production application source or NATS configuration change.

D7 implementation adds `preservation_journal.py` and its owned fault tests in
this audit directory. It is a journal primitive for the replacement driver,
not a managed shutdown command. Directory/file fsync precedes each mutation;
single-writer locking, chained records and boot identity preserve interrupted
intent. A failed durable write poisons the open handle so it cannot overwrite
uncertain intent. Recovery alone may restore prior states after a reboot or
failed verification, in dependency order, with explicit readiness evidence.
The operational driver and real service-stop checks remain in step1.2.

## Mid-Implementation Findings
The first full-node read-only baseline after bus3.11 refused because the
actual mesh-agent is loaded but idle. `daemon` required running, while
`known-broken` would waive the running-state check. D21 adds a narrow
on-demand class only for that worker and confines known-broken to Discord.
No serving bus or client was stopped for this schema correction. The direct
file hashes are structural evidence only; dependency closure and a production
restoration adapter remain required before a preservation window.
Claude's separate review found a running on-demand worker would be sent to
`restore()`; the Journal now refuses before restoration intent. A scratch
reproduction with the immutable 3.11 parser showed it can rename a later
full-node receipt as corrupt. This early description of the active-transition
trigger is superseded by D21: a manual commission rerun after a completed timer
transition can reach the old parser once a full-node receipt reads `restored`.

Claude Message46 accepts9deef65, then identifies discarded raw kernel errors
and the missing pre-watch startup-rewrite negative. Retain raw events before
classification, refuse EV_ERROR, restore that negative and supply a structural
ready-before-intent helper. Explicitly document inode/path limits. Twenty
actual Mac controls pass with one cross-domain skip; v45's missing-import
draft remains refused. Four owned NATS stops and one idle memory stop supply
historical production-size samples only. Discord is disabled with no token;
its unconditional restart loop cannot be treated as a working integration.
Claude Message40 accepts the adapter only within its limited scope and identifies
timeout, orphaned process-group, child/fork, identity/environment and idle-timer
race gaps. This next adapter checkpoint handles those stop-evidence gaps with
owned controls, without a production window. The current installed task unit
reports exit timeout5; timeouts come from actual loaded job output, not an assumed
template default. Darwin's header says NOTE_FORK does not expose the child PID
and NOTE_TRACK is unsupported; any observed fork/exec therefore refuses the
window rather than claiming complete automatic child tracking. Delivery order
is observational, not a kernel exit timestamp. Timer status/log checks cannot
prove an atomic unload; missing independent spawn evidence must refuse complete
verification. No production quiet window is authorized by this checkpoint.

Installed CLI 0.3.1 ignores `stream restore --config`: its restoreAction shadows
`cfg` inside the input-file branch (upstream cli/stream_command.go:1272), leaving
the outer override unset. The owned R3 fixture confirmed a config declaring R1
still fails with replicas>1 on a standalone server. Use the explicit `--replicas`
flag without --config; test it. No upstream fix or tool upgrade in this step.
Original health TTL remains intact; restored expired points are not liveness.

Claude Message 74 independently passed the pinned Linux fixture and actual
offline-driver path. Its operational blocker was the reboot race left by bootout:
D6 now requires a persistent reversible disable. The assignment deletion negative
case, deleted-list cross-check, empty-directory hashing and path decoding refine
the same preservation outcome. Production snapshot restore exposed the explicitly
listed serializer differences in RECOVERY.md; compare equivalent API queries,
never weaken policy or content checks to get a pass.

The 20:55 EDT VM reboot invalidated old owner/CID/counter baselines. Explicit
worker restoration passed a separate 65-second idle guard; selected task state
and nine non-expiring bus states match preserved older evidence. D7 binds fresh
server identity, admission counters, durable state and a reboot-resumable
journal. Owned admission checks and revised recovery fixtures pass; the real
managed orchestration and three healthy cold stores remain unaccepted. Memory
shutdown still swallows drain errors and does not itself await external worker
threads; a fresh empty external-job anchor plus conservative post-anchor log
refusal is required. Further lifecycle changes require their own bounded step.

Post-stall recheck found one worker claim-loop timeout at21:18:53 EDT, followed
by an idle reply and unchanged owners/task fields. Existing node-watch requests
exercise Ollama while the memory queue says idle; the runner was consuming
about900% CPU. This is a carry-forward resource/monitoring finding, not proven
causality or an extra repair in this step. Preserve the healthy-stop refusal
until fresh stability and safe operational sequencing are independently proved.

Claude review of35e56ff exposed management-only Raft observation and uncaught
HTTP protocol errors. Account-filtered observations and an actual stream-leader
regression correct the same quiet-window mechanism. Recovered stability covers
management/routes only; it is not all-group or preservation acceptance.

Claude Message24 found additional b38933a journal faults. D10 narrows the same
recovery mechanism: full explicit inventory, one persistent parent, redundant
baseline restoration, terminal-gap reconciliation and busy timer/serialization
controls. No operational healthy-stop claim follows. The owned launchd probe
provides actual kernel exit-status evidence only; real child/CID negative cases
and the managed driver remain required. CI's first mesh.tasks.list503 at fixture
line113 feeds a separate lifecycle readiness step, leaving this suite red until
that prerequisite is fixed and verified.

Claude Message30 independently passed the twenty cleanup-skipping creation
crash-boundary cases and ENOSPC recovery on ab7097c, then found owned regular
Finder metadata still fenced restoration inside an initializing root. D12
applies the existing metadata rule at that exact boundary; negative metadata
controls retain fencing. No healthy production bus stops or copy acceptance
follow. The installed PR149 readiness repair is now merged before integration
CI. Its broader managed driver remains to be implemented and verified.

D13 introduces the single managed stop adapter, with actual Mac ownership,
exit/CID/listener, crash, descendant and timer-race controls. The private old
sampled-window driver is retired, retaining forensic bytes. This is a driver
component, not permission to run an incomplete preservation sequence. Exact
static identity, later-child/physical ownership, admitted-client and restoration
checks remain tracked at1.2. N3 exact0b96e93 CI and Claude Message38 pass.

Exact f3bb44f CI failed before Mac test collection in the prior recovery
fixture's stream placement. Its leader-only startup gate did not prove all
three placement peers/current routes. Add explicit full readiness plus an
actual missing-peer refusal; preserve the failed attempts. This remains owned
recovery-fixture verification, with no production source/configuration change.

Claude Message44 accepts8286c96 controls/exact green CI, then identifies
producer tick gaps,5second stop-margin measurements and Discord stop-path
prerequisites for the future driver. Those remain open; no production hold
starts. The present delta binds loaded plist/log provenance and moves expensive
re-binding before intent with kernel file watches. It also completes all eight
placement predicate negatives. Source/library controls remain in active1.2.

Claude Message48 accepts19243eb, but points out exception detail is still only
in memory and non-vnode filters are classified by exclusion. D18 writes the
StopWatch snapshot into post-intent failed journal records and explicitly
requires KQ_FILTER_PROC. Pre-intent preparation still needs private durable
driver refusal records. Owned real-filter/durable-reopen controls cover this
correction; no production preservation or controller completeness is claimed.

Claude Message54's fresh owned reproduction exposes journal hash poisoning
when numeric PID sorting differs from string sorting after reload. D19 rejects
non-string dictionary keys before hashing and makes StopWatch exports string
keys. Successful and failed evidence both need mixed-width reopen/resolve
controls. Do not alter old forensic bytes or claim the new tests prove a
complete production controller. Raw kernel trace growth still needs a finite
driver budget before operational use.

### Foundation dependency checkpoint — 2026-09-29 07:12:37 EDT

Consume accepted bus3.1–3.4 by integrating main51a817f. Recast this still-open
PR as the bounded recovery-tool foundation specified in D20 and
FOUNDATION_CHECKPOINT.md. Code/test bytes remain5fabf6e; only plan/evidence
clarifications accompany integration. Fresh private Journal58/58 passes;
exact integration CI/read-only re-review remain required before merge. Do
not close1.2 or introduce production imports, controller, holds or timer wiring.

### B5 owned journal-mount source slice — 2026-10-17 00:44 EDT

The active slice feeds B5-stopped-ASIF checkpoint extraction: wrap the D191
reader in an owned-fixture-only read-only ASIF mount and publish a receipt
of exactly the inputs it read. It does not enable production capture or
close B5. D168/D173/D174/D175 and the four separate histories remain binding.

Needs: published checkpoint/commitment/reader source at 5b6c84af, a completed
owned capture, caller-supplied role table and no active capture worker. File
deltas: host_journal_mount.py, probe_asif_mount_ownership.py,
test_host_journal_mount.py, reader read-metadata output and its tests, both
scripted CI paths, and the plan/evidence ledgers. The probe stays unwired;
native mount facts and the protected B3/acceptance roots are separate gates.

Verify: scripted mount suite passes, every new boundary has a decisive
negative, designated unmutated controls pass, one-rule mutations fail for
their intended reason, Claude challenges the final bytes, then exact-head
CI passes. Native ASIF ownership/flags/ctime behavior must be observed on
an isolated CI runner before claiming mounted-image verification. These
scripted checks never mount a volume or touch a VM. Source publication
does not satisfy the disposable-macOS reboot rehearsal.

Current local evidence: 60 scripted macOS tests OK (one Linux platform-guard
skip), 30 reader tests OK, 119 wrapper/probe mutations killed with no runner
problems. The updated 46 reader mutations are all killed for their intended reason
with unmutated controls passing and no runner problems. The previous
published head has all five checks green in CI run 38930108319; that says
nothing about this uncommitted delta.

Mid-implementation finding: the probe's cleanup repeats eject by disk
number without re-binding it to its own image, unlike the wrapper's
cleanup. A timed-out applied eject can release that number for another
image. Claude is reviewing this and the probe's partial-attach, interrupt
and recursive-removal boundaries before source publication or any native
probe execution. No production VM, service, image or timer changed.

The scripted counterexample is reproduced locally: the first eject times
out after releasing the probe image, the simulated disk number is reused,
and the probe issues one foreign eject and reports clean. All command and
inventory functions were mocked; no disk command ran. Claude confirmed
the retry defect and additional partial-attach, unreadable-inventory,
interrupt/report and recursive-removal defects. The previously passing
119 mutations do not cover these cases. Corrected source plus decisive
tests is required before the CI-only probe can be published or executed.


2026-10-17 01:10 EDT — D192 source candidate: the acf2e671 patch was
checksum-verified (93548a7d…63356) and applied. A new direct counterexample
then reproduced foreign eject on a second cleanup with a stale attach disk
list. Codex removed remembered-number eject authority from wrapper and probe;
missing/unreadable inventory now keeps cleanup uncertain. Final local checks:
71 scripted tests OK (one Linux-only skip), 30 reader tests OK, 46 reader
mutations and 3 focused eject-rule mutations killed with controls passing.
No native mount/probe/VM action occurred. Broader candidate probe mutations
are not claimed as final validation. Final Claude review and exact-head CI
are pending; B5-owned-journal-mount source is not yet ready. The next gate
is native owned ASIF characterization on an isolated CI runner; B5-macOS-
access and the separate reboot rehearsal remain open, and B6 stays closed.


2026-10-17 02:51 EDT — B5-exact-head-CI diagnostic, D193. Exact b694b342
has four green CI jobs and the recurring macOS owned-kickstart failure
(39005360286/117316604376); its new reader30/mount71 tests pass. Claude
Message85 reports no material defect on that head. The ten-second timeout
still leaves recovery partial, gate closed and receipt unresolved.

Goal: distinguish the owned launchctl client's post-timeout state from
service state, without changing any recovery rule. Needs: exact owned argv
and temporary root, original D180 behavior and no production hook. Feeds:
B5-exact-head-CI diagnosis/source readiness, then B5-native-ASIF-mount.
Verify: six subprocess controls and three decisive mutations pass, a native
owned restoration emits the exact-client trace, and the revised head receives
Claude review and CI. The native control succeeded with a 9.008 s request;
this is not a cause attribution for CI. Only a test helper, its tests, the
existing owned test and scripted CI registration change. Action10s, post-
timeout observation1s and parent20s limits are unchanged; no fixture throttle
override or runtime code changes. All production state stays unchanged.

The next two gates remain reviewed exact-head source CI (owned resources
only, B1 authorization) and then native ASIF characterization on an isolated
CI-created image after source readiness. Disposable macOS reboot access is
still separate; B3/B4 were not recaptured, B6–B9 stay closed and the node
is not accepted as operational.

2026-10-17 04:45 EDT — B5-native-ASIF-mount preflight. Exact source
151bb3bdbcdf0bd09c7d15e6f0679832edae6a3d has all five checks green in
39011578564; Claude Message89 finds no material defect, following Message85's
review of the unchanged mount/probe source. The native owned kickstart trace
completed at exit 0 in 9.026776584 s against the original 10 s limit. This
does not explain the earlier timeouts. The current JSON-only caller cannot
reach Claude's hypothetical non-serializable diagnostic context; record that
limit without broadening this change into diagnostic hardening.

The independently executable next gate is native ASIF mount characterization.
Needs: the reviewed probe and cleanup, a separate GitHub-hosted macOS runner,
all existing CI-only guards, and a fresh 64 MiB image created by the probe.
File deltas: add one isolated job and unconditional report upload to
.github/workflows/test.yml; correct the probe's now-obsolete unwired docstring;
record D194 and the verified source milestone in the plan ledgers. No mount,
capture or recovery implementation changes. Verify: inspect the uploaded
report's actual ownership, root-0600 denial, flags, identities/ctime/xattrs
and cleanup, not merely job exit 0; any failed assumption stays a refusal.
Claude review and exact-head CI remain required for this workflow revision.
No local disk image or VM operation is part of this gate. After it, the owned
stopped-ASIF reader integration needs reviewed wiring and a native fixture;
D62 reboot rehearsal still needs separately designated macOS access.


## Native characterization re-orient — 2026-10-17 04:51 EDT
- Still step1.2/B5, never a production stop or capture.
- D194 executed the existing owned probe on a separate CI runner; setup refused.
- Two native findings: owner enforcement exposes root-owned fixture root; attach IDs differ in spelling.
- Correct only probe preparation/evidence retention and test those real boundaries.
- File deltas add probe/tests plus raw report, hashed evidence and append-only ledgers; wrapper unchanged.
- Same native verification outcome; no gate widening to D62/production or timer changes.


2026-10-17 04:51 EDT — B5-native-ASIF-mount first actual report, D195:
6ae7dd58 run39018637637/job117355795880 failed exit1 during write setup,
PermissionError13 after ownership enable; no readonly variant ran. Retained
artifact12096210442 is copied unchanged as B5_NATIVE_ASIF_FIRST_REPORT_20261017.json.
Inventory-bound unmount/eject succeeded and final inventory0/mounted[]/removed
are recorded, but bare disk7 was not harvested, so disks_gone[] is vacuous.
The root-owned volume-root permission explanation is an inference pending
native rerun, not a traceback-proven cause. Actual attach entries are bare
IDs; inventory and DeviceNode use /dev paths. The wrapper still refuses that
spelling and is unchanged.

Codex-owned correction within this same native characterization gate: make
only the newly created probe volume root runner-owned after enableOwnership
(the root0600 file remains root-owned), strictly canonicalize attach IDs for
absence checks and Data observation, and retain partial variant evidence on
failure. No eject fallback is restored. The wrapper's checks are not relaxed.
75 scripted tests pass (one platform skip); four intended-reason mutants are
killed and nine focused controls pass. B5_NATIVE_ASIF_SETUP_20261017.json
records report/source/log hashes. New native CI and Claude review are pending;
this corrects the source fixture rather than retrying unchanged code. Next
native observations then owned reader integration remain held until their
actual verification. B5/1.2 open, B6–B9 closed; no local mount or VM action.
