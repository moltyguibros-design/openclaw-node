# Recovery frontier — 2026-10-13 00:04 EDT

This is the Codex desktop heartbeat's short control surface for recovery step
1.2. It does not change `INVENTORY.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, the no-stop rule, or
the criteria for closing a step. Recheck the listed evidence at every wake;
do not treat this snapshot as current merely because it is in the repo.

**Current outcome:** 1.2 is `[A]/v1.2-pre`. The OpenClaw node is not accepted
as operational. No production service or VM stop is authorized. The standalone
NATS store and all three cluster-member stores, including the held R1 member,
must remain separate until each history has an accepted preservation path.

## Critical path and advance warnings

| ID | Gate and present state | Owner and exact unblock action | Evidence required to clear | First downstream operation held |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | **Cleared for design only by D168.** The operator's “GO” selected the revised stopped-VM physical boundary in the reviewed candidate. A complete no-writer proof is not claimed on the live mounted Data volume. | Codex designs and tests only on owned resources. This decision gives no authority to stop or restart a production service or the VM. | D168 records the chosen boundary and its limits. B6 remains a separate, fresh, exact-window release. | Boundary design B5; never B7 directly. |
| B2 | **Cleared for the disposable mechanism only.** Codex registered a separate Apple-backend UTM VM with its own ASIF disk and a verified Alpine ISO. It started and stopped normally; while `UF_IMMUTABLE` guarded that stopped disk, UTM refused its start and remained stopped; after unlock it started and stopped normally. The production VM stayed started throughout. | Codex carries this owned result into B5's host boot controller; no further VM creation is needed for B2's guard mechanism. B5's macOS reboot rehearsal has a separate access requirement. `utmctl start` exited 0 even on the refused attempt, so the controller must check the resulting state and error. | `audits/step12_jetstream/B2_UTM_GUARD_REHEARSAL_20261012.json` records distinct VM/disk identities, ASIF format, guard refusal, unlock recovery and final states. This is not a production boot-denial certificate. | B5 controller implementation and owned tests. |
| B3 | **Just-in-time installation pins:** the October 9 candidate names `viewer-observed-20261008`; the installed viewer has since moved to `viewer-plan-task-links-autosave-20261011`. The 23-job candidate is unapproved and can drift again. | Codex resolves known structural drift now, but re-captures all 23 installed jobs and direct file hashes only immediately before an approved window. Repeating the capture before a window is scheduled does **not** count as progress. | Current installed identities and hashes match the reviewed baseline at window entry. | B6 and B7. |
| B4 | **Cleared as a bounded design input:** all 23 installed plists and direct launch files, activation keys, and current GUI/user/system OpenClaw-label observations are captured. Claude's adversarial review at `ac954055` found no remaining concrete false claim. This is not a no-writer certificate. | Codex carries the identified child, deploy, viewer, bus and file-writing routes into B5; transitive and out-of-cohort writers remain fail-closed uncertainties for the window-time census and stopped-VM boundary. Re-running this static capture alone is not progress. | `audits/step12_jetstream/B4_WRITER_PROVENANCE_AUDIT_20261012.md` and its JSON cover all 23 labels, classify the only observed system-domain OpenClaw label, name re-entry edges, and state residual uncertainty without claiming pre-stop physical exclusion. | Boundary design B5. |
| B5 | **In progress, owned design and rehearsal only:** the journal refuses every serving NATS stop until the prior-loaded non-NATS cohort has class-specific verified persistent stops and is unloaded and disabled. The root transfer reader checks the bound cohort, but that transfer is production-disabled and is not a prerequisite of D168's stopped-VM preservation boundary. The host arm nonce, committed four-store manifest and post-commit started-state ACK pass owned early-stop and changed-store negatives; 16 host-capture and three reconcile tests pass. **Two newly identified blockers remain:** no capture-ready journal checkpoint and frozen-journal verifier exist; full-node `recover()` explicitly refuses a changed boot, while the hold pins a transient filesystem device number across reboot. `Journal.close()` only releases locks, so the former “durable journal close and root outcome” target was unreachable and is withdrawn. The manifest is not bound to a stopped-ASIF journal, and the full-node abort/restore controller is absent. No physical no-writer proof exists. | Codex builds and adversarially tests a restore-only `capture-ready` checkpoint after all four NATS roles are quiesced under the original hold, binds its host arm nonce and journal head to the four-store manifest, and verifies the frozen user-owned journal from the stopped ASIF. Keep the production-disabled root transfer for a later migration window. Remove the transient device number from durable hold identity under D42 and test an owned APFS image detach/reattach. Implement D62/D64's reboot rule: retain host boot denial until a durable ACCEPTED decision after B8 or an ABORT decision after host cleanup; before guest recovery, bind that decision and compare every boot-time OpenClaw job and process with the recorded hold, refusing unexpected starts. Rehearse launchd/login/hold reattach on disposable macOS, then finish the fail-closed abort/restore controller and reviewed exact runbook. A stuck guard needs an operator-visible outcome. No live shutdown or production-service stop belongs to B5. | Reviewed source and decisive owned negatives for missing/foreign stop receipts, stale checkpoint, altered frozen head, guard denial, premature boot decision, unexpected boot-time start, planned-reboot admission and abort; D62 disposable-macOS reboot rehearsal showing persistent disable, login-start refusal, complete process comparison and hold reattach; exact-head green CI; written entry/abort/resumption criteria. A fixture alone cannot satisfy the macOS rehearsal. | Per-window release B6. |
| B6 | **Separate live-run release required.** B1's boundary choice and B5's design review never authorize a production stop. | Operator gives a fresh, explicit go/no-go for one exact attended window only after B2, B3 and B5 pass. The two-hour heartbeat may prepare and warn, but must never initiate the live stop. | Recorded window-specific authorization naming the reviewed runbook, current pins, host operator and abort contact; it explicitly names D173/D174's user-owned pre-stop evidence without root attestation, D62's ACCEPTED-or-ABORT pre-boot rule and the manual-restoration fallback. Without it, B7 remains closed. | Live hold and shutdown B7. |
| B7 | **Live full-node hold and shutdown closed.** No service or VM stop has occurred for this recovery. | Only in the attended, specifically authorized B6 window, execute the approved sequence and abort on any failed precondition. No single NATS member may be stopped as a rehearsal. | Application quiescence under the approved boundary, clean VM shutdown, active host boot denial and definitive physical no-writer proof at the boundary specified by B1. | Stopped-VM capture B8. |
| B8 | **Four-store capture and isolated acceptance closed.** No three healthy cold masters have been accepted. | Bind host capture and restore tools to the four declared physical paths and volume, then restore the copies on isolated servers. | Four separately hashed path/volume/window-bound copies faithfully reproduce the observed bytes; offline streams, counts, sequences and expiring-stream treatment match. This does **not** prove historical independence of the four members; that needs deployment-time provenance outside this capture. | Step 1.2 closure and any topology change. |
| B9 | **Verified resumption closed.** A successful fixture cannot establish live recovery. | Follow the reviewed restore order, check all previously active services and writer routes, and record failures or success without claiming operational status early. | The 23-job prior state, NATS identities and routes, application health and retained histories match the approved acceptance contract; then step 1.2 may close. | Coordinated point 1.3 and a truthful operational claim. |

The host `ACKED.json` is its own receipt; the guest's receipt and shutdown
choice are not yet bound to the frozen journal or stopped ASIF. That is B5 work,
alongside reboot-safe restoration and the abort controller. D168 requires a
stopped-VM boundary, not a root NATS handoff before capture.
Append-only D174 narrows D173's byte-continuity and reboot claims; use D174
for implementation and B6 review.

**B5 advance warning, found by the Claude adversarial review of `598013c3`:**
the root decline path can publish `declined` for a schema-valid user journal
with no execution hold or service-stop receipts; root admission rejects that
same forged journal. Root decline and the guest transfer entry point also
refuse production use. Do not treat a declined outcome as proof of the hold or
make it B5's next task. The capture-checkpoint design avoids that path and
retains the root transfer for later topology work. Separately, a clean VM
shutdown changes the guest boot; `Journal.recover()` refuses a full-node
cross-boot recovery before any restoration, and hold object identity may also
change. The heartbeat must surface this as **B5-reboot** if owned tests cannot
establish a reboot-safe restore-only path. B6 cannot be offered until that path
and the abort/resumption runbook are reviewed; a file edit or passing fixture
alone does not clear the blocker.

**B5-reboot access forecast:** B2's existing disposable VM is Alpine, so it
cannot test macOS launchd, login-start and process behavior across a guest
reboot. Codex can build and test the restore-only source and use an owned APFS
image detach/reattach to test durable hold identity. D62's full mechanism
still needs a disposable macOS VM or spare Mac, never production `moltMacOS`.
Codex first checks for an existing isolated machine, installer and host
capacity. Provisioning a new macOS VM needs a separate operator decision on
its disk budget after that read-only assessment. Never quit or restart UTM or
the host, touch `moltMacOS` configuration, or test against its disk. Before
and after each test step, verify the production VM's state, disk identity and
image holder are unchanged; abort on any change. Free host space after the
installer and fixed-size test disk must remain at least the 20 GiB capture
floor plus a measured production-image growth margin. This is a forecast,
not B6 permission.

The next two gates after a hold are **stopped-VM capture of all four physical
NATS stores** and **isolated, real-history restoration/acceptance**. Their
fixtures are useful only when bound to authentic guest/host origin and the
actual four source roles; synthetic receipts do not close them. Verified
resumption must follow acceptance, not precede it.

**B5 source-merge warning:** the high-severity dependency fixes from PR #226
are integrated into draft PR #224. The previous head's workflow was 5/5 green.
At `66e4c2bd`, three jobs are green, `legacy-writer-lock-macos` is still
running, and Node 22 `unit-tests` failed in owned cluster stream creation with
`no suitable peers for placement, peer offline` after the 155 preservation
journal tests passed. Treat exact-head CI as red while investigating that
readiness failure; these D174 corrections need their own run. Green CI alone
will not close the checkpoint, full-node abort/restore or physical boundary.

## Heartbeat decision rule

At each wake, inspect the live plan/worktree and check B1–B9 in dependency
order. Choose one independently executable task that directly removes a named
gate, with a predeclared verification. A test or document counts as progress
only if its result changes that gate's state or establishes a required
production-bound prerequisite. Keep step 1.2 open until its runtime contract
is actually satisfied.

B1's design choice is recorded, but B6 is still closed. No automation or
agent may infer production-stop authorization from B1, the B4 audit, or B5.

An actionable blocker is itself a material event. Emit `NOTIFY` immediately
for a newly discovered or changed blocker, an overdue blocker, or a decision
needed from the operator. Name its ID, evidence, owner, exact unblock action,
and the downstream operation it prevents. A thread `NOTIFY` is an emission,
not a delivery receipt. Repeat an unacknowledged operator blocker once each
24 hours after the previous alert, even if an earlier `NOTIFY` remains in the
thread. Emit `DONT_NOTIFY` only when there is no new gate movement, no newly
actionable blocker, and no overdue re-alert.

The heartbeat's `NOTIFY` output is a Codex task notification. Delivery to
ChatGPT Dot has **not** been verified. Do not claim a Dot warning was sent
until the user confirms that this task's notification reaches Dot or a
supported connector is configured and tested.
