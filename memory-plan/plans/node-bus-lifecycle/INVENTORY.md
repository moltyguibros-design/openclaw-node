## Block 1 — Planned mesh-client drains

| Block | Step | Version | Status | Description |
|-------|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | 1.1 | v1.1 | [x] | Complete deliberate task-daemon shutdown normally — 2026-09-28: reviewed 0f2e148 on staged e57, real managed exit 0/completion, single-instance gap and RPC readiness pass |
| 1 | 1.2 | v1.2 | [x] | Complete deliberate idle bridge shutdown normally — 2026-09-28: reviewed 9056e59, ten owned controls, managed exit 0/completion and restart, task states unchanged |
| 1 | 1.3 | v1.3 | [x] | Complete deliberate idle worker shutdown normally — 2026-09-28: source 69b7f37, nine owned controls, two managed exit-0 stops/restarts, task state unchanged, Claude closure accepted |
| 1 | 1.4 | v1.4 | [x] | Reject task-daemon false completion or silent success when bus loss overlaps requested drain — 2026-09-28: a2f5293 owned outage controls; managed connected stop/restart79423/exit0; unchanged state; Claude141 accepts |

> **1.1 — Goal:** the existing task daemon completes a requested idle shutdown with its normal exit status.
> **Needs:** live idle task daemon; owned nats-server 2.12.6 fixture; immutable live e57f89b source; D1/D2; user-authorized implementation/deployment and Claude adversarial collaboration.
> **Feeds:** node-state-recovery 1.2's shutdown gate; task-daemon launchd restart semantics.
> **Verify:** `code:` real-process tests on Node 22 and installed runtime Node: SIGTERM and SIGINT exit 0 with one completion line; repeated signals during held drain remain single-shot; unexpected permanent loss exits 1; unpatched source fails the planned-stop control. Full suite in isolated CI. `runtime:` staged e57 lifecycle-only diff matches source repair; fresh idle proof; deployed managed daemon SIGTERM emits completion and exits 0, then its managed replacement answers read-only requests. Healthy bus owners/viewer/gateway remain unchanged.


> **1.2 — Goal:** the existing bridge completes a requested idle shutdown normally.
> **Needs:** 1.1 closed; same-race source and live stop log reverified; owned authenticated NATS plus isolated kanban/observability state; original runtime unit; immutable e57 base; D4.
> **Feeds:** node-state-recovery 1.2's bridge stop gate.
> **Verify:** `code:` unpatched real idle bridge fails the completion control; patched SIGTERM/SIGINT complete once, unexpected permanent loss retains exit 1, full isolated CI green. `runtime:` lifecycle-only staged release; fresh idle proof; managed stop emits `Bridge stopped.` with normal exit, managed restart reports no orphaned mesh tasks under the idle precondition without changing task state; prior-request owned fixtures cover existing-ID reconciliation; unrelated service owners unchanged.

> **1.3 — Goal:** the existing worker completes a requested idle shutdown normally.
> **Needs:** 1.2 closed; same-race source/owned worker repro reverified; owned NATS/task daemon and isolated worker HOME/Git/state; existing worker unit; e57 base; D4.
> **Feeds:** node-state-recovery 1.2's worker stop gate.
> **Verify:** `code:` unpatched real idle worker fails the completion control; patched SIGTERM/SIGINT complete once, unexpected permanent loss retains exit 1, full isolated CI green. `runtime:` lifecycle-only staged release; fresh idle proof; managed stop emits `Agent worker stopped.` with normal exit, explicit kickstart of the preserved loaded unit (KeepAlive=false/RunAtLoad=false) answers alive=false/task_id=null without claiming work; unrelated service owners and task rows unchanged.

> **1.4 — Goal:** requested task-daemon drain must not report success while reconnecting or when permanent close carries an error.
> **Needs:** 1.3 closed; fresh owned reproduction of the independent task-daemon outage findings; accepted 1.1 source/runtime preserved as its narrow connected-idle contract.
> **Feeds:** node-state-recovery 1.2 strict connected stop gate; node-readiness 4.1 failure semantics.
> **Verify:** `code:` real owned-daemon early and late loss during shutdown fail with exit 1 and no completion; connected TERM/INT/repeated-signal controls retain exit 0; mutants removing either actual-closed or error-bearing-close checks fail. `runtime:` e57 lifecycle-only release, fresh idle proof, connected managed stop/restart and read-only readiness; no task-state/unrelated-owner changes. No general async-handler completion claim.

## Block 2 — Verifiable service readiness

| Block | Step | Version | Status | Description |
|-------|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| 2 | 2.1 | v2.1 | [x] | Publish task-daemon readiness after its subscriptions reach the bus — 2026-09-29: sourceb190671/tests8ab8350 green; Claude30/32/34 challenge; exact staged barrier; fully recorded managed exit0/restart82096 and scoped state preservation |

> **2.1 — Goal:** a task-list request made at the task daemon's ready declaration must reach its registered handler.
> **Needs:** merged main dad1e7b; exact CI failure at worker fixture113; owned authenticated NATS2.12.6; real-daemon startup controls; accepted live e57 task-outage release preserved; independent Claude challenge.
> **Feeds:** node-state-recovery1.2 readiness gates and root lifecycle CI; node-readiness1.5 restart semantics.
> **Verify:** `code:` a preconnected owned client requests immediately at the real daemon ready line; retain unpatched failure/control counts and reject readiness while the final real flush return is held; its injected failure must exit1 without ready. Patched source answers without retry. Full isolated CI passes. `runtime:` stage only the readiness barrier on the live cumulative lifecycle release, verify exact entry/dependencies, and after a fresh idle guard perform one managed stop/start with real RPC readiness and unchanged task/bus/other-owner state. Do not call source-only evidence deployment.

## Block 3 — Scheduled application quiescence

| Block | Step | Version | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | 3.1 | v3.1 | [x] | Establish the durable foreground execution-hold primitive — 2026-09-29: approved source0f0dcc2/CI3of3;40 Mac controls, actual timer drain/159 inert exit0 fires/real reopen and verified cleanup |
| 3 | 3.2 | v3.2 | [x] | Complete local consolidation invocations before reporting completion or releasing their foreground guard — 2026-09-29: approved159b8dd/CI3of3;158 Mac/Linux controls, seven old-source failures, owned gate/notification and pending atomic-write completion |
| 3 | 3.3 | v3.3 | [x] | Stop the explicitly disabled Discord tool from crash-looping before a new preservation baseline — 2026-09-29: approved f21c6df/CI3of3; owned10 controls/Mac policy; live one normal inactive run/65s84 samples/13 other owners unchanged; qualified Claude84 review |
| 3 | 3.4 | v3.4 | [x] | Report confirmed disabled Discord inactivity without hiding real mesh failures — 2026-09-29: approveda4291c4/CI3of3; auth-preserving managed19976, old747 exit0;81.816s/122 checks/two reports; paired36 cells only net.mesh changes; qualified Claude96 |
| 3 | 3.5 | v3.5 | [x] | Restore interrupted execution holds through the sole durable preservation journal — 2026-09-29: source dbffa1a approved by Claude106/exact CI3of3; private Mac33 hold+47 gate+58 Journal controls; restore-only recovery, no production hold |
| 3 | 3.6 | v3.6 | [x] | Capture the existing transcript archive in the tracked timer contract — 2026-09-29: approved61d2d78/CI3of3; exact old bytes/unit, real filter/update/retention controls, owned Mac run1/exit0/two archives/verified teardown |
| 3 | 3.7 | v3.7 | [x] | Expose bounded restore-only recovery through the sole Journal — 2026-09-30: source f72820c accepted by Claude85/exact CI3of3; private Mac 27 owned+33 hold controls, real closed/reopened timer fires, restored-only resolution, no production mutation |
| 3 | 3.8 | v3.8 | [x] | Stage the complete reachable consolidation execution graph — corrected 2026-09-30: loaded Node24 release -4/real-entry probe, both native files pinned, Claude no blocker, root CI Node20/22 green; baseline Mission Control audit red, no production timer |
| 3 | 3.9 | v3.9 | [x] | Pin the five timer launch environments and protected entry contract — 2026-09-30: private candidate -5 verifies five jobs/1,885 sources; six Mac controls; Claude review and exact root Node20/22 CI pass, existing Mission Control audit red; no live install |
| 3 | 3.10 | v3.10 | [ ] | Prove a safe first transition from the actual ungated timer entries |
| 3 | 3.11 | v3.11 | [ ] | Install the reviewed execution hold on the five actual Mac timers |

> **3.1 — Goal:** a durable closed marker plus foreground lock excludes scheduled application execution after drain, even after controller exit.
> **Needs:** Python3/fcntl, installed Node/shell/launchd, Claude50/52 contract, D15.
> **Feeds:**3.2/3.4/3.5 and recovery1.2.
> **Verify:** code:40 real owned Mac controls, mandatory external lock/root pins, separate restoration type, permanently refused watch sessions, isolated exact CI; runtime:private deployed source pins, actual inherited-lock positive/negative controls and a scheduled Mac job that starts twice while closed with unchanged application count and no job log bytes. Independent source review. Additional actual timer proof closes in-flight drain,159 individually normal closed fires during365s and real reopen. No live installation claim.

> **3.2 — Goal:** a consolidation invocation remains active until its local cycle, event publications and foreground notification have completed.
> **Needs:**3.1 closed; fresh CLI/in-process call inventory; no early return after cancellation or max-age orphaning; explicit foreground Linux notification contract; owned source/dependency isolation.
> **Feeds:**3.5 foreground entrypoint contract and recovery1.2's delegated-work idle gate.
> **Verify:** code: delayed abort cleanup cannot return early; a signal-ignoring cycle cannot overlap a second invocation; delayed/rejected event ACK and actual owned notification child remain inside completion; stop fences new invocations and waits for active work, both real callers await it; isolated CI. runtime: exact private deployed source, actual owned cycle/notification process and controlled stop/guard observation, with no live source or shared dependency change. Remote inference and general memory-daemon drain are separate.

> **3.3 — Goal:** explicit channels.discord.enabled=false ends the optional tool normally before bus connections/writes, without enabling the integration.
> **Needs:**fresh disabled/no-token config observation, real owned tool controls, conditional KeepAlive contract, explicit inactive baseline state.
> **Feeds:**recovery1.2's complete inventory and parent1.5/2.2.
> **Verify:**code:disabled exits0 with no bus/writes; real enabled-path failure restarts; runtime:reviewed exact source/unit policy, one normal disabled run then loaded/not-running stable, no Discord client, original integration remains disabled.

> **3.4 — Goal:** mesh monitoring distinguishes confirmed optional Discord inactivity from a service failure.
> **Needs:**3.3 closed/merged; actual false-BROKEN report; loaded Discord HOME/normal-exit state; immutable existing node-watch viewer-auth release; D20.
> **Feeds:**the actual node-watch/MC status surface;3.5/3.6 and recovery1.2's new complete baseline.
> **Verify:**code:strict false plus loaded/not-running/exit0 is explicitly OFF within the mesh aggregate, with observed running peers retaining WORKING; enabled/legacy absence, failure exits, disabled-running contradictions and other failed/unobservable units cannot earn false health; missing/malformed/unobserved effective config cannot authorize inactivity. runtime:owned native controls, exact staged/live watcher retaining viewer-auth changes, managed normal stop/restart then two actual reports show the qualified inactive detail, other owners/config/source preserved. Full node health/preservation is not claimed.

> **3.5 — Goal:** the sole durable preservation journal restores an interrupted hold without certifying the lost interval.
> **Needs:**3.1 and accepted PR144 journal primitives; baselined external root/lock pins; durable intent/receipt schema; explicit original-session and restoration-only boundaries.
> **Feeds:**3.6 and recovery1.2/1.3.
> **Verify:**code/runtime:owned interruption before/after publication, before receipt and after drain; mismatch/missing/broken markers and straggler refusal; broken open holds re-closed/drained and window failed before restoration; before/after same-session brackets around every stop/copy; explicit dependency readiness before reopen; no autonomous pin recapture or false certification. Full production preservation remains recovery1.2.

> **3.6 — Goal:** the runtime-only archive script and hourly Mac unit become immutable tracked inputs for timer commissioning, preserving their current behavior.
> **Needs:**3.5 closed; exact live archive bytes/plist and source hashes; existing installer workspace copy path; owned private HOME and Mac launchd fixture; D22.
> **Feeds:**3.9/3.11's five-entry contract; the existing workspace installer copies the new script. Service activation remains3.11.
> **Verify:**code: exact script byte identity, parameterized plist renders to the original unit without scheduling/argv/log changes, meaningful transcript-filter/update/retention controls and isolated CI/source review. runtime: copied source in an owned private HOME actually archives fixture transcripts through /bin/sh and foreground rsync; an owned Mac unit runs the exact copied body normally and is verified unloaded. No production source/unit update, archive repair or Linux service acceptance.

> **3.7 — Goal:** an interrupted declared hold has one usable restore-only command, using the existing Journal/node_lock and saved immutable baseline.
> **Needs:**3.5/3.6 closed; merged sole Journal and hold facade; reviewed bounded CLI design and exact saved-baseline/check contract.
> **Feeds:**3.11's recovery handoff and recovery1.2.
> **Verify:**code/runtime: owned real interrupted holds recover and resolve, never seal or certify; a live Journal owner refuses; missing/substituted pins or unreadable durable state refuse without mutation; all-service/physical readiness and write failures retain their existing boundaries. No new journal/controller or production stop/copy.

> **3.8 — Goal:** a private release carries the complete reachable consolidation foreground graph, including generated schemas and chosen native/subprocess resolution, without changing shared dependencies.
> **Needs:**3.7 closed; accepted3.2 source; fresh actual graph/drift/delegation inventory; isolated runtime/store/bus consumers and compatible installed dependencies.
> **Feeds:**3.9/3.11's source identity and foreground contract.
> **Verify:**code/runtime: static literal and computed resolution, native binding and subprocess inventories agree with the staged graph; meaningful private real-entry/event/notification/cleanup controls pass with source/dependency identity retained. No hidden memory-daemon deployment or remote-inference cancellation claim.

> **3.9 — Goal:** the five rendered timer entries have the reviewed launch environment contract and protected admission/source pins, preserving application interpreter/flags/cwd/schedules; consolidation and observer have the declared source-path relocations of D25, and D26 governs the inherited SSH-agent socket.
> **Needs:**3.6/3.7/3.8 closed; actual loaded plist/environment/command resolution; existing Python-I-S runner; protected location outside ordinary deploy copy/chmod/prune.
> **Feeds:**3.10/3.11's installation baseline.
> **Verify:**code/runtime: owned launch-boundary/preload/delegation mismatch and code/pin substitution negatives refuse before application work; exact application settings and new supervisor prefix are explicitly baselined. An in-Python check cannot retroactively protect Python's dynamic loader. No production units installed.

> **3.10 — Goal:** the first ungated-to-gated transition cannot interrupt unaccounted old application or child writes.
> **Needs:**3.9 closed; actual old source/child lifetime and unit stop behavior; an owned demonstrable admission-fence or actual drain-safe transition. Root-only debug is unavailable until specifically handed off.
> **Feeds:**3.11's first-install mutation gate.
> **Verify:**runtime: owned replicas stress admission/active child/durable-write boundaries, preserve completed output, and unload cleanly. Polled idle and launchctl disable on an already-loaded unit are not admission proof. No forced old production stop to manufacture evidence; an unavailable safe route blocks actual installation.

> **3.11 — Goal:** the five actual Mac scheduled jobs remain application-inert throughout an accepted coordinated interval and reopen to their prior scheduling state.
> **Needs:**3.2/3.3/3.4/3.5 and3.6–3.10; complete actual source/loaded-argument/env/schedule/import-graph and other-invoker inventory; real interpreter-I-S; code/pin protection outside deploy copy/chmod/prune or explicitly coordinated deployment; persistent baseline and sole restore-only recovery handoff.
> **Feeds:**recovery1.2/1.3 and parent node-readiness1.5/2.2.
> **Verify:**code: installer/templates and gate/code-change negatives; runtime:exact staged/installed entries preserve existing schedules/env/argv, closed scheduled starts do no application/log work, delegated memory drains separately, journaled reopen only after dependency readiness with original baseline restored. No Linux continuous-watch or global OS-spawn claim.
