# Workflow — From Master Plan to Shipped Code

**Date:** 2026-05-28. This is the connective tissue: how an intent becomes a deployed, observed change. It marries the new discipline layer (MASTER_PLAN + runtime-evidence) with the old 9-phase execution rigor (FRAMEWORK.md) so neither is bypassed.

If you only read one thing before working a redesign step: read this, then the step's row in `INVENTORY.md`.

## 1. The five layers (top governs bottom)

```
┌─ LAYER 1 — GOVERNANCE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ MASTER_PLAN.md   principles · done-contract (runtime evidence) · forbidden│
│ DESIGN_INPUTS.md the taste check (Karpathy LLM-Wiki · one-hop · no bullshit)│
└───────────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┘
                                         │ constrains
┌─ LAYER 2 — ROADMAP ─────────────────────▼──────────────────────────────────┐

└───────────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┘

┌─ LAYER 3 — STEP LIST ───────────────────▼──────────────────────────────────┐

```

## 2. The chain — how a decision becomes shipped code

```
DESIGN_INPUTS (intent)
   → DECISIONS (locked choice)
      → MEMORY_REDESIGN (which phase/block)
         → INVENTORY (which atomic step)
            → 9-phase execution (FRAMEWORK)
               → VERIFY includes runtime evidence (deploy + restart + observe)
                  → COMPONENT_REGISTRY updated (component moves toward LIVE)
                     → one commit (the step closes)
                        → viewer shows it closed; next step unblocks
```

Every arrow is auditable. If a step exists with no DECISIONS/REGISTRY basis, it shouldn't be in the inventory. If a commit exists with no closed step, the framework was bypassed.

## 3. The per-step lifecycle (old 9-phase + new discipline, merged)

For each `INVENTORY.md` step, in order. **Bold = added by the new discipline on top of the old FRAMEWORK.**

| Phase | Action | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-flight | Pick next `[ ]` step. Clean tree. Read MASTER_PLAN + the step's MEMORY_REDESIGN phase + prior step's AUDIT_POST §6. | FRAMEWORK §8 |
| **1·§0** | **MICRO RE-ORIENT (≤6 lines, first thing in AUDIT_PRE) — see §7. Zoom out before digging in.** | **§7** |
| 1 | **AUDIT_PRE** — intent, design decisions (consume carry-forwards), risk register, file-delta outline. | FRAMEWORK |
| 4 | Implement every §6 delta. No scope creep — surprises go under AUDIT_PRE `## Mid-Implementation Findings`, not silent expansion. | FRAMEWORK + **MASTER_PLAN §4.3** |
| 5 | **VERIFY = (a) tests green at baseline [old] + (b) RUNTIME EVIDENCE [new]: deploy to `~/.openclaw/workspace/`, restart the service, observe the new behavior in logs / the watcher / a DB query / an HTTP probe.** | FRAMEWORK + **MASTER_PLAN §4.1, §5** |
| 7 | **AUDIT_POST** — files-vs-plan ledger, greppable deltas, cross-refs, findings, carry-forwards. | FRAMEWORK |
| 8 | Corrections (usually none). Architectural choice needed → BLOCK + log in DECISIONS. | FRAMEWORK |
| 8.5 | **DEEP REVIEW GATE — the 5 checks [old] + a 6th: runtime evidence cited.** Any fail → BLOCK, no commit. | FRAMEWORK + **new** |
| 9 | Commit (one). Flip INVENTORY `[A]`→`[x]`. **Update COMPONENT_REGISTRY (component status). Log any DECISIONS.** | FRAMEWORK + **new** |
| **Block close** | **MACRO RE-ORIENT (Global Review) before the next block's first step — see §7.** | **§7** |

One commit per step. No mid-step commits, no amends, no force-push (FRAMEWORK §4). After the commit, STOP — one step per work unit.

## 4. What's different from the old framework (why this isn't just FRAMEWORK.md v2)

The old framework closed 59 steps with zero gate failures — and produced ~0 working production change, because "done" meant "committed + tests green," and the runtime was never updated. The five additions fix exactly that:

1. **Done = runtime-observable** (Phase 5b + Gate check 6). A step that compiles and passes tests but doesn't change the running system is NOT done.
2. **One step, its §6 deltas only.** No drift, no "while I'm here." (The scope-check hook that once gated this was removed 2026-09-23, protocol D10.)
3. **No parallel implementations / no work outside the inventory** (MASTER_PLAN §4.6, §4.10). The thing that produced the dead `bin/openclaw-memory-daemon.mjs` is forbidden.
4. **COMPONENT_REGISTRY is living truth**, updated per step — so "what actually runs" is never a mystery again.
5. **DESIGN_INPUTS taste check** — a step that fails the Karpathy-wiki intent or the one-hop bar needs an explicit DECISIONS entry before it's built.

## 5. The viewer's role

The workplan-viewer (:7892) makes the whole chain visible:
- **Legacy tabs** (Live / Steps / Documents / History) render this plan's `INVENTORY.md` + the per-step `audits/` exactly as they did for the old framework.
- **Master Plan tab** (built 2026-05-27) renders `COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md` + `DECISIONS.md`.
- Once **Block 2 (memory-watcher)** ships, the system being tracked also reports its own live operations — the viewer shows the plan, the watcher shows the running reality.

One glance = where we are (version), what's next (first `[ ]` step), what's broken (registry badges), what we decided (decisions).

## 6. Starting a step (the checklist)

```
[ ] git tree clean; on main
[ ] read MASTER_PLAN.md + this step's phase in MEMORY_REDESIGN.md
[ ] Phase 1 §0 MICRO RE-ORIENT (≤6 lines — see §7)
[ ] Phase 1 AUDIT_PRE in redesign/audits/stepNN_<slug>/
[ ] Phase 4 implement (only the §6 deltas; surprises → AUDIT_PRE Mid-Implementation Findings)
[ ] Phase 5 tests green + DEPLOY + RESTART + OBSERVE (capture the evidence)
[ ] Phase 7 AUDIT_POST
[ ] Phase 8 corrections (or BLOCK)
[ ] Phase 8.5 Deep Review Gate (5 checks + runtime-evidence)
[ ] Phase 9 commit + flip INVENTORY + update REGISTRY + log DECISIONS
[ ] if this step closed a BLOCK → MACRO RE-ORIENT (Global Review — see §7)
[ ] STOP
```

## 7. The Re-Orient Loop — countering attention-span deficit

**The problem this solves:** digging into one step's implementation detail makes the global picture fade — you finish a tree and forget the forest, then drift (do the next adjacent thing, lose the plan). Willpower doesn't fix this; structure does. So re-orientation is *mandatory and scheduled*, at two cadences. **The deeper you dig, the more often you must surface.**

### 7.1 Micro re-orient — every step (the floor)

The **first thing** written in every step's `AUDIT_PRE.md`, before any design or code, is a `## §0 Re-orient` block — ≤6 lines, answering:

```
- Where am I:   Block <N> (<phase name>), step <Y>/<block total>, <K>/<grand total> overall.
- Last step changed: <one line — what just shipped>.
- This step contributes: <how it serves the BLOCK goal>.
- Block serves the north star via: <the MASTER_PLAN/DESIGN_INPUTS line it advances>.
- Still the right next step? <yes / no → if no, BLOCK + re-plan, don't proceed>.
```

It's cheap (60 seconds) and it forces a look-up-from-the-trench before every dig. If you can't fill it in, you don't understand where you are — stop and re-read the plan.

### 7.2 Macro re-orient — every block close (the ceiling)

When a step closes a **block**, before the next block's first step, run a **Global Review** — a full zoom-out (this is the loop that catches accumulated drift):

```
[ ] Re-read MASTER_PLAN principles + DESIGN_INPUTS taste check (Karpathy-wiki, one-hop).
[ ] Update COMPONENT_REGISTRY: did the components this block touched actually move toward LIVE?
    Verify with RUNTIME PROBES (ps / curl / sql / log), not memory.
[ ] Re-survey the remaining inventory: are the NEXT block's steps still atomic, correct, and
    correctly ordered given what this block taught us? Re-run the atomicity test. Re-order/split if needed.
[ ] Drift check: any change landed that wasn't in a step? Any Mid-Implementation Finding now worth a step?
[ ] Log any course-correction in DECISIONS.md before continuing.
```

This guarantees the whole picture gets re-established at least once per block — so deep work inside a block can never silently derail the plan.

### 7.3 The within-step tripwire (atomicity ↔ attention)

Atomicity and attention are the same lever. A properly atomic step (§INVENTORY atomicity test) is small enough that you *can't* get lost in it. So:

> **If Phase 4 implementation accumulates many sub-actions OR surfaces ≥2 mid-implementation findings, that is a signal the step was not atomic.** Stop. Re-orient (§7.1). Consider splitting the step and re-planning. Do not push through a step that has quietly become three steps.

### 7.4 The viewer is the re-orient surface

Both cadences read from the same place the operator does: the workplan-viewer's **Master Plan tab** (COMPONENT_REGISTRY / DECISIONS) + the **inventory progress**. The global view is always one glance away — that's why it was built first. The micro re-orient is "glance at the tab before you dig"; the macro is "study the tab before you start a block."
