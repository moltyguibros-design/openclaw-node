# protocol — Roadmap

**Goal.** The workplan operating system itself, made a versioned, instantiable, enforceable base
that every plan iteration inherits instead of hand-copying from the previous plan.
**Created:** 2026-06-03 (retro-documented at step 2.4; Blocks 1–2 were inventoried before their
steps ran — this doc consolidates the block framing per PROTOCOL §1.2).

## Block 1 — The protocol base

- **Intent:** the base exists — one synced rulebook (PROTOCOL.md + hoisted FRAMEWORK_CANONICAL +
  generalized BLOCK_TEMPLATE), one generic chain engine (plan-tick.sh + shim convention), one
  scaffolder (new-plan.sh + canonical/templates/) yielding viewer-valid silos in one command.
- **Exit criterion (runtime-observable):** a scaffolded demo silo is listed by the live viewer
  and tick-preflightable end-to-end; sync `--check` rc 0. [MET 2026-06-03 — commits 519be08,
  5a15329, 5fdf278.]
- **Unblocks:** Block 2 (rules must exist on every surface before they can be enforced).

## Block 2 — Conformance: every plan functionally wires every surface

- **Intent:** the operator directive of 2026-06-03 — each plan functionally implements the six
  viewer surfaces (master-plan, steps, automation, block, documents, history), the 9-phase
  protocol, and extreme step atomization (Goal/Needs/Feeds/Verify) — made written law (§10/§11),
  machine-graded (plan-lint.sh), unavoidable (scaffold + preflight wiring), and obeyed by this
  very silo.
- **Exit criterion (runtime-observable):** `plan-lint.sh protocol` rc 0; conformance line in this
  plan's own preflight reads CONFORMANT. [MET at 2.4 close — see step evidence.]
- **Unblocks:** terminal for now. Future blocks (operator-scoped): retiring the historical
  per-plan tick scripts onto the generic engine; contract retrofit for repair's 29 open rows;
  cross-plan pipelines (COWORK_MODEL §5).

## Block 3 — Governance recovery

- **Intent:** restore the plan system as a trustworthy control surface after implementation work
  flowed through expired scopes and past the VERSION carriers: exactly one active scope, current
  runtime registries, coherent frontier statuses, and public documentation that distinguishes
  shipped substrate from unproven behavior.
- **Exit criterion:** the three current-frontier silos (protocol, federation, HyperAgent) lint with
  zero FAILs; exactly one unexpired active scope exists during recovery and no stale scope remains
  active at close; federation and HyperAgent preflights name their real next gates; README,
  CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md agree with fresh 2026-08-02 probes; the recovery commit is pushed.
- **Unblocks:** the runtime-repair batch, followed by federation 2.6 evidence and the 3.5 gate.

## Block 4 — Runtime repair

- **Intent:** remove the concrete failures that make the node's memory cadence, dependency graph,
  process watcher, and scheduler heartbeat either nonfunctional or dishonest. Each defect class is
  an atomic step with its own deploy/restart/runtime proof.
- **Exit criterion:** a scheduled consolidation crosses its queue-aware idle gate and emits to the
  authenticated local event stream; one Sharp/libvips tree loads in a full watcher run; stale
  gateway artifacts and PID-less launchd jobs cannot grade WORKING; scheduler-heartbeat records an
  authenticated HTTP 200 and launchd exit 0.
- **Unblocks:** federation 2.6's five-task premise benchmark on a stable, honestly observed node.

## Block 5 — Operating-base amendments from outside evidence

- **Intent:** the base has been amended so far only from its own failures. That is a narrow
  evidence source: it catches what already went wrong here and never what this design simply
  omits. This block takes amendments from mature outside systems that solve the same problem —
  agent-governance toolkits with their own constitution/spec/task/verify lifecycles — reads them
  against our surfaces, and lands only the gaps that are real here, each with a mechanical check.
  Borrowing prose without a check is how a governance idea decays into etiquette, which is
  precisely the weakness these outside systems exhibit.
- **Exit criterion:** every amendment in this block is (a) traceable to the named external source
  with its licence recorded in DECISIONS, (b) expressed in a canonical doc or template rather than
  advice, and (c) graded by `plan-lint.sh` — where a check cannot have teeth without grading
  closed history, it lands as an explicit WARN tier and says so in the script's grading comment.
- **Unblocks:** nothing downstream depends on this block. It is maintenance of the base itself,
  which is this silo's whole subject.
