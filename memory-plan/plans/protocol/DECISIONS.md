# DECISIONS — protocol plan (append-only)

Architectural decisions for the workplan operating system itself. Newest at bottom. Never rewrite an entry; supersede with a new one.

---

## D1 — The protocol base is canonical-synced docs + instantiated templates + one generic engine (2026-06-03)

**Decision.** The reusable base every plan iteration inherits has three tiers:

1. **Synced** (identical in every silo, authored in `memory-plan/canonical/`, propagated by `sync-canonical.sh`): `MASTER_PLAN.md`, `COWORK_MODEL.md`, `PROTOCOL.md`, `FRAMEWORK_CANONICAL.md`, `BLOCK_TEMPLATE.md`. These are the rules; they must never drift per plan.
2. **Instantiated** (copied once from `canonical/templates/` by `new-plan.sh`, then owned by the plan): `INVENTORY.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `SCOPE.md`, `OUT_OF_SCOPE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md`, `TICK_PROMPT.md`, `automation.json`, `VERSION`. These are the plan's working state; they must diverge per plan.
3. **Engine** (shared executable, never copied): `workspace-bin/plan-tick.sh <id>`, fronted per plan by a generated two-line shim `workspace-bin/<id>-tick.sh` because the viewer and launchd invoke the tick command with no argv.

**Why.** The silo restructure standardized every per-plan path (`<plan>/INVENTORY.md`, `<plan>/VERSION`, `<plan>/audits/`, ...), which collapses most of FRAMEWORK's placeholder table into convention. What remained plan-specific before (tick scripts, prompt files, workflow docs) was being hand-copied and accumulating stale paths — COWORK_MODEL §5 already flags the legacy tick scripts as dead automation. One synced rulebook + one parameterized engine ends that class of drift.

**Consequences.** `legacy/` and `redesign/` keep their historical `FRAMEWORK.md`/`WORKFLOW.md` copies as the record of how those plans ran; `PROTOCOL.md` governs new plans. Their `BLOCK_TEMPLATE.md` copies are overwritten by the canonical generalized one (canonical-doc semantics).

## D2 — VERSION_LOG is retired; git log is the per-bump ledger (2026-06-03)

**Decision.** The standard silo carries no `VERSION_LOG.md`. The redesign plan already ran without one: one commit per step on `main` means `git log` IS the append-only step ledger, and `audits/` carries the per-step narrative. `FRAMEWORK_CANONICAL.md` still describes VERSION_LOG for non-git contexts; in this repo it is satisfied by the commit log.

**Why.** A second hand-maintained ledger duplicating git history was pure bookkeeping overhead and a drift source in the legacy plan.

## D3 — Conformance is law, machine-graded, with grandfathering (2026-06-03)

**Decision.** Operator directive: every plan must *functionally implement* the six viewer
surfaces (master-plan, steps, automation, block, documents, history), the 9-phase protocol, and
extreme step atomization via a four-field contract — **Goal** (one outcome), **Needs**
(pre-screen, verified Phase 1, missing → BLOCK), **Feeds** (named consumer, recorded Phase 9),
**Verify** (enforceable test tagged `runtime:`/`code:`/`visual:`, executed Phase 5; visual-only
→ headless ticks BLOCK). Encoded as PROTOCOL §10/§11; graded by `plan-lint.sh` (PASS/WARN/FAIL,
rc 0 = conformant); surfaced unavoidably at scaffold end and every tick preflight.

**Why.** "Gracefully degrades when missing" had let silos ship half-wired surfaces; and
done-evidence lines alone didn't force pre-screening (Needs) or downstream accountability
(Feeds). Rules without a checker are advisory (MASTER_PLAN §6: forcing functions, not
willpower).

**Consequences.** Open INVENTORY rows without contracts FAIL; closed pre-contract rows are
grandfathered as WARN. Historical naming variance (ROADMAP under another name, D-heading shapes,
audit-dir naming) grades WARN, never FAIL. Repair's 29 open rows need contract retrofit before
its chain resumes — repair-plan work, surfaced by the lint, not done here.

## D4 — Scope batches are first-class: labeled ```files blocks with a `closed` lifecycle (2026-07-04)

**Decision.** The unit of scope is the operator-directed batch, not the calendar. Each batch gets
its own labeled ` ```files <label> ` block in the plan's SCOPE.md; when the batch ships, the word
`closed` is appended to the fence and the hook prunes that block from the allow-list. The 2026-07-04
planner deep review found the alternative — one ever-growing union — had reached 349 lines /
12 addenda / ~110 permanently-writeable files: the hook's designed failure mode (silent expansion)
performed openly. plan-lint now grades the drift directly (open-entry count, active-scope age,
Runtime-Evidence trailers in recent commits, VERSION-vs-git-activity).

**Consequences.** Finished work re-locks without losing its record. One open block per in-flight
batch is the discipline. The always-writeable SCOPE.md remains the trusted-agent hole it always
was — convention plus the new lint visibility, not enforcement.

## D5 — `[D]` DEFERRED is a first-class step state (2026-07-04)

**Decision.** INVENTORY rows may be `[D]`: deliberately postponed. Deferred rows are never a next
step (tick engine ignores them), never block plan completion (viewer excludes them from
total_steps), and need no §11 contract (lint treats them like grandfathered-closed). Redesign's
four Block-7 federation rows are the first users — the plan now grades CONFORMANT instead of
failing lint for work it explicitly chose not to do (its DECISIONS D4).

**Consequences.** Deferral is machine-distinguishable from unfinished. Reopening a deferred step
is a one-character flip `[D]`→`[ ]` plus writing its §11 contract.

## D6 — The per-plan tick engines are retired; plan-tick.sh is the only engine (2026-07-04)

**Decision.** Per MASTER_PLAN §4.6, `memory-plan-tick.sh` (165 legacy ticks) and the 207-line
`redesign-tick.sh` copy (32 ticks) are replaced by two-line shims over the generic
`plan-tick.sh`; their orphaned `com.openclaw.*` plists are renamed `.disabled`. Plist naming is
standardized on `ai.openclaw.<id>-tick` (docs, templates, viewer defaults, automation.json).
plan-tick.sh no longer counts untracked files as tree-dirt (a concurrent session's new files
must not trip the stall-block) and derives paths from $HOME, not a hardcoded operator.

**Consequences.** One engine to maintain; the chain remains deliberately unloaded for every plan
(loading is an explicit operator decision, viewer Automation tab). D3's repair note ("29 open
rows need contract retrofit") is superseded: repair closed 49/49 on 2026-06-11; its remaining
lint FAILs are the missing automation surfaces of a dormant, complete plan.

## D7 — The concept-summary budget is spent frontier-first, and prose is monotonic (2026-07-16)

**Decision.** `generateConceptNotes` no longer slices the blind top-N-by-mention_count. Candidates
are tiered — 0: no note on disk (coverage first, mention-ordered) · 1: note carries the placeholder ·
2: note has prose (refresh) — and within tiers 1/2 ordered by a boundary score ported from the
AgriciDaniel/claude-obsidian comparison (operator "go", 2026-07-16):
`(out_degree − in_degree) × exp(−age_days/30)` over the vault wikilink graph
(`computeBoundaryDegrees` in lib/obsidian-graph.mjs). Two hardening rules ride along: an existing
LLM summary is preserved when this cycle's LLM returns null (prose never regresses to the
placeholder), and byte-identical rewrites are skipped (`unchanged` in the result).

**Why.** The top-N slice had two structural failures observed live: rank N+1 never got a note
(starvation — the tail was invisible forever), and the same hubs re-rolled the LLM dice every cycle
so one busy-Ollama cycle wiped prose a previous cycle had paid for (Arcane: `last_seen 2026-06-02`,
still placeholder on 2026-07-16 despite daily rewrites). The boundary score sends the scarce
summary budget to recently-active notes that link out more than the graph links back — the growing
edge — instead of to whatever is merely most mentioned.

**Consequences.** Repair 2.9 slug ownership is resolved by mention order *before* prioritization
(colliders can't flip note ownership); repair 2.7 `opts.names` targeting still bypasses nothing —
it filters candidates, then the same tiering orders them. Unchanged-skip spares cloud-sync churn
and no-op graph-cache invalidations. The same batch quoted the decision/session frontmatter
wikilink arrays (the concept writer's 2026-07-04 YAML fix, propagated) — Obsidian/Dataview can now
read `related:`/`concepts:`, and `flattenRelated` in buildGraph is legacy-only from this date.

## D8 — Governance recovery uses one protocol step and reopens unmet evidence contracts (2026-08-02)

**Decision.** The expired protocol, federation, and HyperAgent scopes are retired and replaced by
one narrow protocol step, 3.1. Scope transcripts are not permanent allow-lists: shipped history
lives in git/audits, while unfinished work lives in INVENTORY. The live execution frontier is
federation 2.6 at `v2.6-pre`, followed by 3.5; HyperAgent is idle at v2.0 pending operator-gated
2.1. Federation 6.2 and 6.3 remain unfinished side gates.

**Why.** Three files advertised `Status: active` after their expiries, federation exposed 85 stale
allow-list entries, and VERSION `v6.3` could steer a cold pickup past the unmet 2.6 evidence contract.
Public docs still described retired HyperAgent prompt rules and July runtime state. A control plane
that cannot identify the next executable gate is not enforcing the system it describes.

**Consequences.** Runtime repair is a separate future scope. This governance step records but does
not fix consolidation liveness, NATS event-auth, the invalid local-event stream name, nested native
dependencies, watcher honesty gaps, heartbeat auth, or worker startup. No management work starts
before 2.6 and 3.5 close. Every future batch opens one fresh labeled scope block with a bounded expiry.

## D9 — Runtime repair uses authoritative activity/process signals and one dependency tree (2026-08-02)

**Decision.** The runtime-repair block is split into four independently closable steps. Queue
activity comes from the memory daemon's fresh exported queue snapshot, never Ollama model residency.
Local event stream names are derived through one canonical helper, and standalone NATS clients use
the existing token resolver. Native dependencies resolve from one parent install; nested
`mcp-knowledge/node_modules` trees are forbidden in source and deployed copies. Watcher service
health requires fresh work evidence and/or a real PID, not an old file or loaded launchd label.
Mission Control mutations retain bearer authentication; the heartbeat becomes an authenticated
client instead of weakening middleware.

**Why.** All four old signals were mechanically false on the live node: `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=24h`
made `/api/ps` look permanently busy; a dotted hostname generated an illegal stream name; two Sharp
copies loaded incompatible libvips dylibs and terminated the watcher; an 18-day gateway JSONL and
PID-less launchd labels graded WORKING; unauthenticated curl received 401 forever. These are signal
ownership defects, not threshold-tuning problems.

**Consequences.** Each step must deploy and observe its corrected signal before closing. No auth
exemption, watcher downgrade, dependency duplication, or retrospective health claim is accepted.
Federation 2.6 remains blocked until Block 4 closes.

## D10 — The scope contract is removed (2026-09-23)

**Decision.** At the operator's instruction, the write-gate scope contract is removed entirely:
`.claude/hooks/scope-check.sh` and its `.claude/settings.json` registration; every
`plans/<id>/SCOPE.md` and `OUT_OF_SCOPE.md` (8 + 8) and both canonical templates; plan-lint's
SCOPE, scope-hygiene and OUT_OF_SCOPE checks; the viewer's Current Scope and Out of Scope cards
with their `/scope` and `/out-of-scope` routes; and every instruction to set, refresh, expire or
override a scope (canonical docs and silo copies, TICK_PROMPTs, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, the
pre-protocol WORKFLOW docs). Nothing gates edits. An unrelated observation made during a step goes
under AUDIT_PRE `## Mid-Implementation Findings` or to the operator (MASTER_PLAN §4.3); unfinished
work is tracked in INVENTORY (§4.4). `validate-commit.sh`, `validate-push.sh` and the force-push
deny list stay.

**Why.** The hook refused every edit in the repo whenever no active, unexpired scope existed, so each
lapsed `Expires` date locked the repo until someone rewrote a SCOPE.md, including for work the
operator had asked for. D8 already recorded three scopes still advertising `Status: active` after
their expiries; at removal, the protocol scope had been expired since 2026-09-10 and the only other
active one (openviking-adopt) would have lapsed on 2026-09-28. The operator judged the gate not
worth that cost.

**Consequences.** PR #15 (an earlier, unmerged removal attempt) is superseded. D8's "every future
batch opens one fresh labeled scope block with a bounded expiry" no longer applies. The observations
captured in the removed OUT_OF_SCOPE.md files are not migrated; read them at the last commit that had
them: `git show df503b3:memory-plan/plans/<id>/OUT_OF_SCOPE.md`. Federation step 5.3 used
OUT_OF_SCOPE.md as the savant-proposal inbox and must choose a new one before it can start (flagged
on its row). repair P.4 (scope-check tightening) is moot. Audits, older DECISIONS entries and close
notes that mention SCOPE.md are records and stay as written.
