# Protocol Plan — Step Inventory

The meta-plan: the workplan operating system itself, made a versioned, instantiable base.
Goal: any future plan iteration starts from one command and inherits the full machinery —
canonical governance docs, the 9-phase step protocol, the viewer integration, the tick chain —
instead of hand-copying files from the previous plan.

**One step = one independently-verifiable runtime outcome = one 9-phase cycle = one commit**
(see `PROTOCOL.md` once step 1.1 lands; until then, `plans/redesign/WORKFLOW.md` §3).
Done-evidence must be runtime-observable (MASTER_PLAN §5).

**Status:** `[ ]` queued · `[A]` in-flight · `[x]` closed.
**Version:** `v<block>.<step>`, carrier starts at `v0.0`.

## Block 1 — The protocol base

| Block | Step | Version | Status | Description |
|-------|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | 1.1 | v1.1 | [x] | Canonical protocol docs: PROTOCOL.md + FRAMEWORK_CANONICAL hoist + BLOCK_TEMPLATE generalization, synced into every silo — closed 2026-06-03, synced to 4 silos incl. previously-unmapped `repair/` |
| 1 | 1.2 | v1.2 | [x] | Generic chain engine plan-tick.sh: plan-id parameterized, per-plan shim convention, no per-plan copies — closed 2026-06-03, preflight verified live against all 4 silo states |
| 1 | 1.3 | v1.3 | [x] | Template set + new-plan.sh scaffolder: one command yields a viewer-valid silo; CLAUDE.md pointers updated — closed 2026-06-03, demo silo scaffolded → viewer-listed in 5s → tick-preflight OK → removed. Closes Block 1 (macro re-orient in AUDIT_POST §7) |

## Block 2 — Conformance: every plan functionally wires every surface

Operator directive 2026-06-03: each plan must respect and functionally implement the six viewer
surfaces (master-plan, steps, automation, block, documents, history), the 9-phase protocol, and
extreme step atomization with Goal / Needs (pre-screen) / Feeds (post-use) / Verify (enforceable
test). Steps below use the four-field contract they introduce.

| Block | Step | Version | Status | Description |
|-------|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| 2 | 2.1 | v2.1 | [x] | Conformance + step contracts written into PROTOCOL.md and the templates — closed 2026-06-03, §10/§11 live in all 4 silos |
| 2 | 2.2 | v2.2 | [x] | plan-lint.sh: enforceable conformance checker over the six surfaces + step contracts — closed 2026-06-03, graded all 4 silos truthfully (legacy CONFORMANT, others' gaps named) |
| 2 | 2.3 | v2.3 | [x] | Lint wired into new-plan.sh (scaffold report) and plan-tick.sh preflight (conformance line) — closed 2026-06-03, fresh scaffold = CONFORMANT/1 WARN by design |
| 2 | 2.4 | v2.4 | [x] | Protocol silo itself fully conformant: ROADMAP, REGISTRY, TICK_PROMPT, automation, shim — lint rc 0 — closed 2026-06-03, 15P/1W/0F CONFORMANT; registry live-parses into 3 families. Closes Block 2 (macro re-orient in AUDIT_POST §7) |

## Block 3 — Governance recovery

| Block | Step | Version | Status | Description |
|-------|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| 3 | 3.1 | v3.1 | [x] | Governance recovery closed 2026-08-02: expired scopes retired; federation reopened at its unmet 2.6 premise contract; HyperAgent next gate fixed at 2.1; runtime defects separated into a bounded follow-up; affected plan lints and live viewer evidence recorded in the step audit. |

> **3.1 — Goal:** the workplan surfaces once again identify exactly one writable batch and describe the node's actual 2026-08-02 frontier without inferred completion or improvement claims.
> **Needs:** operator approval (2026-08-02 "go"); fresh plan-lint, git, stack, federation-watch, HyperAgent, consolidation-log, heartbeat, and dependency-audit probes; canonical MASTER_PLAN/PROTOCOL reread.
> **Feeds:** the next runtime-repair scope; federation 2.6/3.5 ordering; HyperAgent 2.1 preregistration; every agent bootstrap through CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md.
> **Verify:** `runtime:` exactly one unexpired active scope during execution and no stale active scope at close; protocol/federation/hyperagent-evidence lint with zero FAILs; federation and HyperAgent preflights name the intended frontier. `code:` README/CLAUDE/AGENTS and registries agree on the probed facts; staged diff is governance/docs only. `runtime:` commit pushed without force.

## Block 4 — Runtime repair

| Block | Step | Version | Status | Description |
|-------|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| 4 | 4.1 | v4.1 | [x] | Restore scheduled consolidation liveness and authenticated local event emission — closed 2026-08-02; queue-aware gate and event path live, cycle completion remains explicitly degraded at the five-minute cap |
| 4 | 4.2 | v4.2 | [x] | Remove nested Sharp/libvips dependency trees from source and deployment paths — closed 2026-08-02; all mcp-knowledge imports resolve root Sharp 0.35.3 and the full watcher exits normally through isolated native probing |
| 4 | 4.3 | v4.3 | [x] | Make gateway freshness and launchd PID state load-bearing watcher evidence — closed 2026-08-02; stale gateway activity and PID-less loaded services now grade non-green, while running coordinator/core services carry explicit PID evidence |
| 4 | 4.4 | v4.4 | [x] | Authenticate the scheduler-heartbeat one-shot against Mission Control — closed 2026-08-02; loopback helper preserves the POST auth gate and launchd recurs with HTTP 200 / exit 0 |
| 4 | 4.5 | v4.5 | [A] | Prove a complete consolidation cycle inside the existing 300000ms hard cap — per-phase timing across all nine checkpoints attributes the overrun, then the dominant phase is optimized; raising the cap is explicitly not the deliverable (4.1 carry-forward #4) |

> **4.1 — Goal:** the standalone consolidation scheduler starts a real cycle when the daemon queue is freshly idle and can emit through the authenticated, validly named local event stream.
> **Needs:** v3.1 governance recovery closed; live memory daemon exports `.tmp/ollama-queue-state.json`; R=3 NATS cluster and token resolver live; consolidation scheduler launchd unit loaded; operator approval 2026-08-02.
> **Feeds:** daily digest/vault cadence; memory event observability; watcher `net.stream`; stable substrate for federation 2.6.
> **Verify:** `code:` focused scheduler/event/watcher/acceptance tests pass and no runtime path uses `/api/ps` as queue activity evidence. `runtime:` deployed scheduler authenticates to NATS, resolves the canonical local stream, and logs a cycle start from a fresh idle queue snapshot while a model remains resident; repo/runtime hashes match.

> **4.2 — Goal:** every in-repo and deployed OpenClaw import resolves one Sharp/libvips version, with the vulnerable nested 0.34.5 tree absent.
> **Needs:** 4.1 closed; root Sharp override 0.35.x installed; current nested source/workspace/legacy-tree copies inventoried; installer dependency topology understood.
> **Feeds:** full node-watch stability; semantic index/embedding imports; dependency-security baseline.
> **Verify:** `code:` install tests and dependency audits pass with no vulnerable Sharp resolution. `runtime:` source and deployed trees contain no nested Sharp install; a full deep watcher exits normally with no duplicate-libvips warning or native mutex abort.

> **4.3 — Goal:** node-watch reports WORKING for gateway and mesh/coordinator services only from fresh artifacts plus running process evidence, never mere historical files or loaded labels.
> **Needs:** 4.2 closes the watcher crash; live launchctl output has both PID and PID-less fixtures; an old gateway JSONL reproduces the false green.
> **Feeds:** operator health dashboard; federation 3.5/6.3 evidence quality; stack incident diagnosis.
> **Verify:** `code:` watcher regressions prove an 18-day gateway file and PID-less mesh/coordinator labels are not WORKING. `runtime:` deployed deep watcher grades the current gateway and mesh/coordinator state from freshness/PIDs and completes without false-green wording.

> **4.4 — Goal:** the launchd/systemd scheduler heartbeat authenticates through Mission Control's existing bearer-token gate and executes scheduler ticks without a browser tab.
> **Needs:** Mission Control auth token file and POST gate live; heartbeat unit currently reproduces exit 22/HTTP 401; workspace installer owns one-shot scripts and service templates.
> **Feeds:** at/cron task dispatch; `ops.calendar` watcher; Mission Control scheduler status.
> **Verify:** `code:` helper/unit/install tests pass and the mutation route remains auth-gated. `runtime:` deployed launchd unit uses the helper, records HTTP 200/tick output, increments its run count with last exit 0, and Mission Control remains reachable.

> **4.5 — Goal:** a real consolidation cycle completes inside the existing `HARD_CAP_MS` (300000ms), and the cycle reports where its time actually goes.
> **Needs:** 4.1 closed (scheduler live and honest at the gate); a populated extraction store on the host; the cap overrun reproducible on a real cycle.
> **Feeds:** daily digest/vault cadence actually completing; promotion-candidate freshness; any future claim that consolidation is healthy.
> **Verify:** `code:` per-phase timings returned for all nine checkpoints and asserted in unit tests; an aborted cycle names the phase holding the cap. `runtime:` a deployed real cycle completes under 300000ms with its phase breakdown recorded, and the phase that previously dominated is shown reduced — a raised cap is not acceptable evidence.

> **2.1 — Goal:** the rules exist in one place: PROTOCOL.md gains §10 (six-surface conformance: what "functionally implements" each tab means) + §11 (the Goal/Needs/Feeds/Verify step contract); INVENTORY + TICK_PROMPT templates carry both.
> **Needs:** PROTOCOL.md §1/§6 (present, v1.1) · the viewer tab↔file map (verified live in Block 1) · redesign's LOOPS.md flow framing as lineage (connects-with/produces-for/WIN-FAIL).
> **Feeds:** 2.2 (the lint checks exactly these rules) · every future plan's INVENTORY/TICK_PROMPT via the templates.
> **Verify:** code — post-sync, `grep -l '## 10. ' plans/*/PROTOCOL.md` hits all 4 silos; `grep -c '**Needs:**' canonical/templates/INVENTORY.template.md` ≥ 1; `sync-canonical.sh --check` rc 0.
>
> **2.2 — Goal:** conformance is checkable by machine: one command grades any silo per surface (PASS/WARN/FAIL) and exits non-zero on a required failure.
> **Needs:** 2.1's §10/§11 (the spec the lint encodes) · the four real silos as test corpus (one complete, one blocked, one archived, one mid-conformance).
> **Feeds:** 2.3 (scaffolder + engine call it) · the operator (the conformance report is the review surface) · any future CI gate.
> **Verify:** runtime — `plan-lint.sh protocol` correctly FAILS pre-2.4 (missing ROADMAP/TICK_PROMPT/automation) and `plan-lint.sh redesign` reports its true mixed state; exit codes match the report.
>
> **2.3 — Goal:** conformance is unavoidable at the two birth/run moments: scaffold end prints the lint report (what to fill in), tick preflight prints the conformance line (what would block).
> **Needs:** 2.2's plan-lint.sh (exists, executable) · new-plan.sh + plan-tick.sh (Block 1).
> **Feeds:** every future `new-plan.sh` run · every tick preflight · 2.4 uses the wired report as its own evidence.
> **Verify:** runtime — scaffold a demo: lint report appears in scaffold output naming the unfilled contracts; `plan-tick.sh <demo> --preflight` includes the conformance line; demo removed.
>
> **2.4 — Goal:** the meta-plan passes its own law: protocol silo gains ROADMAP.md, COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md (probed), TICK_PROMPT.md (bindings filled), automation.json, protocol-tick.sh shim.
> **Needs:** 2.1–2.3 closed · templates (Block 1) · live runtime probes for the REGISTRY entries.
> **Feeds:** the viewer's six tabs for plan `protocol` (operator-visible) · the tick chain (plan becomes autonomously drivable for future base evolution) · the lint's first green run (the reference conformant silo).
> **Verify:** runtime + visual — `plan-lint.sh protocol` rc 0; viewer `/api/plans/protocol/{scope,registry,decisions,out-of-scope}` all `present:true`; Automation tab shows the shim resolvable (`tick_command_exists:true`).

**Block 1 done-evidence (historical — pre-contract format):**

> **1.1:** `workspace-bin/sync-canonical.sh --check` exits 0 AND `PROTOCOL.md` is byte-identical in `canonical/` and every `plans/*/` dir.
> **1.2:** `workspace-bin/plan-tick.sh <id> --preflight` correctly reports each silo's true state without invoking claude — redesign: next step 7.1 (the open DEFERRED row; deferral enforced at TICK_PROMPT layer) · repair: BLOCKED.md PRESENT → would exit · protocol: in-flight `-mid` · unknown id: FATAL rc=1. [Evidence wording corrected at close — see AUDIT_POST §4.]
> **1.3:** `new-plan.sh <demo>` produces a silo the live viewer (:7892) lists in its plan index with tabs rendering; `plan-tick.sh <demo> --preflight` names the demo's first step. Demo removed after evidence capture.
