# Repair Plan — Step Inventory

Every finding from `FINDINGS_2026-06-02.md` decomposed to **true atomic grain**, v2 after the 2026-06-02 operator-directed atomization review (v1's bundled steps split — see DECISIONS).

**Atomicity test (applied to every step):** one step = one independently-verifiable runtime outcome = one 9-phase cycle = one commit. If describing a step needs "and" between two independently-testable outcomes, it is split. The only sanctioned bundles are ones where the parts are NOT independently verifiable (each is justified inline).

**Structure rule:** every step carries an explicit **Goal** (the single outcome) and a **Proof** (the runtime-observable validation gate). *A step whose Proof is not produced and captured is NOT done — it is in-flight or blocked, never closed.* A step whose Proof cannot be written concretely is not ready to start (applies to the two `defined-at` placeholders, 2.9 and 3.4).

**Procedural rule:** every step runs the full per-step lifecycle in `WORKFLOW.md` §3 (identical protocol to the redesign plan):
Pre-flight → **Phase 1·§0 micro Re-Orient** → Phase 1 AUDIT_PRE (in `audits/stepNN_<slug>/`) → Phase 4 implement (surprises → AUDIT_PRE Mid-Implementation Findings) → Phase 5 VERIFY = tests green **+ runtime evidence per the Proof line** (deploy via symlinks, restart, observe) → Phase 7 AUDIT_POST → Phase 8 corrections-or-BLOCK → Phase 8.5 Deep Review Gate (5 checks + Proof cited) → Phase 9 one commit with `Runtime-Evidence:` trailer + flip `[ ]→[x]` + registry/DECISIONS updates → **macro Re-Orient at every block close** (where placeholder steps get defined and the next block is re-atomicity-checked). Tripwire (WORKFLOW §7.3): ≥2 mid-implementation findings or sub-action sprawl = the step wasn't atomic → stop, split, re-plan.

**Operator priorities (2026-06-02):** (1) vault + wikilink referential system fully implemented, transparent, working — D7; (2) LLM infrastructure audited before further wiring — D8; (3) security PARKED until working prototype (Block P).

**Sequencing rationale:** Block 1 precedes the vault headline because the vault is *generated from* the tables Block-1 bugs corrupt every 30 minutes (R1-R4). Built first, the referential system would render fiction.

**Status:** `[ ]` queued · `[A]` in-flight · `[x]` closed.
**Version:** `v<block>.<step>`, carrier starts at `v0.0`.
**Driver:** `tick` (autonomous-safe) · `hybrid` (tick implements, operator verifies runtime — redesign Blocks 4-6 pattern) · `operator` (interactive only).

## Block 1 — Stop the data corruption · R1-R5, R39

| Block | Step | Version | Status | Driver | Description |
|-------|------|---------|--------|--------|-------------|

| 1 | 1.8 | v1.8 | [x] | operator | Data repair B: rebaseline salience + mention_count |

> **1.1 Goal:** at most one tick body executes at any time.
> **1.1 Proof:** induce a >30s tick (real LLM flush); the overlapping interval fire logs `tick skipped (in-flight)` and the watcher shows zero interleaved Phase-2 ops; regression test asserts the skip. [DONE 2026-06-02 — tick wrapped in the shared `createConcurrencyGuard` (maxAgeMs 30min), both call sites routed, skip logged. Runtime: PID 9102, induced long tick via planted gateway session `repair-11-verify` → boot tick 15:36:54, interval fire 15:37:24 logged `tick skipped (in-flight)`, zero interleaved Phase-0/2 sequences; watcher ingested the session ok. Tests 1493/0 (5 new in test/daemon-tick-guard.test.mjs — first defense of workspace-bin/memory-daemon.mjs).]
>
> **1.2 Goal:** decay is idempotent w.r.t. cycle frequency — N cycles in a window decay the same total amount as 1.
> **1.2 Proof:** on a copy of state.db, 3 consolidation cycles inside 1h decay an idle entity ≤0.4% total (per-cycle elapsed-time factor ≈0.1%, not the compounding ~33% observed pre-fix); `entities_archived` gains 0 rows across the 3 cycles in idle steady-state; unit test with a frozen clock locks the formula. [DONE 2026-06-02 — `last_decayed_at` anchor on entities+decisions (migration in initConsolidationTables); anchor = max(last_decayed_at, recall); written only on applied decay so sub-threshold composes. Copy-run: cycle2 decayed=0, cycles2-4 drift 0.19%, archived 961→961 (0 new) vs pre-fix "all 110 every cycle". Tests 3 new frozen-clock, 20/20 file.]
>
> **1.3 Goal:** a co-occurrence pair reinforces once per new shared-session evidence, never per cycle.
> **1.3 Proof:** SQL snapshot diff across 2 consecutive cycles with no new sessions = zero `mention_count`/salience change; adding one new shared session reinforces each member exactly +1; regression test. [DONE 2026-06-02 — `cooccurrence_state` credited-evidence table (lazy create); credit only on evidence growth; shrink tracked. Copy-run: cycle1 seeds 102 (the set live was re-crediting every cycle), cycle2 reinforced=0/identical snapshots/SUM(mention_count) unchanged, +1 new shared session → exactly +1 each. Tests 22/22 (2 new).]
>
> **1.4 Goal:** a flush over already-extracted content is a recorded noop, not a re-extraction.
> **1.4 Proof:** two `runFlush` calls over an unchanged session → the second inserts 0 mention rows (SQL) and the watcher records the op as `status:noop`/skip; a grown session extracts only the delta (new mention rows reference only new turns). [DONE 2026-06-02 — `extraction_state` content-hash table; dedup gate skips LLM+synthesis, returns zero-count extraction → watcher noop. Live daemon (synthesisMs 60s, reverted): flush#1 16:04:17 `[llm]` ok/12 mentions, flush#2 16:04:55 `[llm-dedup]` noop/entities=0, SQL 0 new mention rows post-20:04:30Z. Suite 1499/0.]
>
> **1.5 Goal:** every new mention's `turn_index` references a turn that exists.
> **1.5 Proof:** post-fix extraction → new mentions carry `turn_index == messageCount-1`, and a JOIN against the session's real turns returns rows (no orphan index); regression test. [DONE 2026-06-02 — stamp messageCount→messageCount-1; bug-locking test corrected (asserted 3 for a 3-message session → 2). Runtime: real-LLM deployed runFlush on the 4-message fixture → all mentions turn_index=3, JOIN to messages: 8 matched / 0 orphans. Tests 12/12.]
>
> **1.6 Goal:** MEMORY.md can never be observed half-written.
> **1.6 Proof:** grep shows zero bare `writeFileSync` on the MEMORY.md paths (pre-compression-flush ×2, memory-budget) — all routed through `lib/atomic-write.mjs`; one live flush observed updating MEMORY.md intact; tests green. [DONE 2026-06-02 — 3 sites → atomicWriteFileSync (budget keeps mkdirp). Grep clean; observed deployed flush wrote intact with no .tmp residue; suite 1499/0.]
>
> **1.7 Goal:** entities archived by the R1 bug are back in the live table.
> **1.7 Proof:** dated `state.db` backup exists before the repair; restoration count logged; SQL shows restored entities live with preserved fields; the handling of their `entities_archived` rows (delete vs flag) decided in-step and logged in DECISIONS with the counts. [DONE 2026-06-03 — operator decisions: restore all non-colliding (941), salience 0.5 + fresh anchor, flag restored_at. Backup at backups/pre-step-1-7-2026-06-03/. Live 132→1073; 0 field-preservation failures across 941; 20 collisions left archived; 0 sub-floor. Precondition verified first: overnight post-fix cycles Decayed 24-45/0 archived, Reinforced 0.]
>
> **1.8 Goal:** salience and mention_count reflect documented formulas, not the bug equilibrium.
> **1.8 Proof:** sampled SQL assert `mention_count == COUNT(mentions)` for entities that have mention rows; entities without rows get the documented baseline; salience histogram shows no mass pinned at the 1.0/≈0.158 artifacts; values stable (≤0.3% drift) across 2 idle cycles; formula + numbers logged in DECISIONS. [DONE 2026-06-03 — operator decisions: distinct-session recount (132 entities, 0 mismatches; restored 941 keep preserved counts, 0 disturbed) + uniform salience 0.5/fresh anchor (0 rows ≠ 0.5; both artifacts gone). Stability copy-run: 0.208% drift over 2 cycles, 0 archived, mention sum stable. Backup pre-step-1-8. CLOSES Block 1; macro Re-Orient in audits/step08.]

## Block 2 — The vault referential system · D7 · R6-R10 · **the headline**

| Block | Step | Version | Status | Driver | Description |
|-------|------|---------|--------|--------|-------------|
| 2 | 2.1 | v2.1 | [x] | hybrid | All local vault/synthesis writers transparent (D7, R6) |
| 2 | 2.2 | v2.2 | [x] | tick | One shared slugify for writers + UI route (R7) |
| 2 | 2.3 | v2.3 | [x] | tick | Promoter writes only new/changed notes (R8) |
| 2 | 2.4 | v2.4 | [x] | hybrid | Build the vault link-integrity checker (manual run) (R9) |
| 2 | 2.5 | v2.5 | [x] | hybrid | Checker runs on the synthesis cadence + surfaced (R9) |
| 2 | 2.6 | v2.6 | [x] | hybrid | Referential coverage report (R9) |
| 2 | 2.7 | v2.7 | [x] | hybrid | Concept-note coverage backfill to 100% (R9) |
| 2 | 2.8 | v2.8 | [x] | hybrid | Generators emit only resolving wikilinks (R9) |
| 2 | 2.9 | v2.9 | [x] | operator+hybrid | themes/decisions surfaces + duplicate aliasing (defined after 2.6; shapes operator-confirmed) |
| 2 | 2.10 | v2.10 | [x] | tick | memory.synthesized carries session_id (R10) |
| 2 | 2.11 | v2.11 | [x] | tick | Truthful trigger labels at every flush site (R10) |

> **2.1 Goal:** no local writer consults the private flag (D7); the vault shows everything.
> **2.1 Proof:** grep shows no privacy-filtered path remaining in local vault writers (consolidation summaries, promoter, summarizer call sites); one consolidation cycle AND one flush each produce notes for previously-private entities (before/after file diff). The `private` column + filter machinery remain in code (federation-era, D4) — just unconsulted locally. [DONE 2026-06-03 — summarizer default flipped to transparent (filter = federation opt-in via respectPrivacy:true); flush call-site redundancy removed; F-N102 tests converted to D7-default + opt-in pair. Live scheduler cycle wrote 5 notes incl. private=1 restored entities; deployed flush wrote 10 (mode=llm). grep clean; tests 48/48.]
>
> **2.2 Goal:** one slugify definition, every producer and consumer of note filenames uses it.
> **2.2 Proof:** grep — single definition, imported by `obsidian-summarizer` and the mission-control memory-content route (and any other slug site); a >60-char concept name renders its prose in the content browser (HTTP check that returned "No concept note" pre-fix). [DONE 2026-06-03 — gate substituted (single import impossible across the file-copy deploy boundary; documented in audits/step10): byte-equivalent mirror + source-parity test (10-case battery + no-cap lock). Runtime: 89-char-slug entity's prose rendered via live API post-deploy (was null). Tests 3/3.]
>
> **2.3 Goal:** promoter is idempotent — unchanged vault state writes nothing.
> **2.3 Proof:** two back-to-back promoter runs → second writes 0 files (vault mtime snapshot identical); a changed entity rewrites exactly its own note. [DONE 2026-06-03 — change detection sans volatile promoted_at + atomic writes + deterministic slug-collision first-wins (the tripwire find: OpenClaw/openclaw ping-pong; duplication defect captured to OUT_OF_SCOPE). Live double-run: 23 promoted → 0 promoted/23 skipped, mtimes byte-identical, 1 collision reported. Tests 10/10.]
>
> **2.4 Goal:** a checker exists that reports the vault's referential integrity.
> **2.4 Proof:** CLI run against the live vault outputs note count, wikilink count, dangling links (listed), orphan notes (listed); a deliberately seeded dangling `[[link]]` is detected by name; removing it yields a clean run. [DONE 2026-06-03 — lib/obsidian-link-checker.mjs + bin/vault-check.mjs (+--json). Live: 75 notes/1213 links → 488 exact, 204 slug-resolvable (no aliases anywhere — 2.8's queue), 521 dangling (mostly [[sessions/uuid]] never written), 28 orphans. Seed detected by name, cleared on removal. Tests 4/4.]
>
> **2.5 Goal:** the checker runs automatically on the synthesis cadence and its result is visible.
> **2.5 Proof:** after a live flush, a watcher record carries the dangling/orphan counts; the mission-control surface shows the latest counts matching a manual CLI run. [DONE 2026-06-03 — vault_integrity in the synthesized schema (dist rebuilt), measured in runFlush post-synthesis (non-fatal), passed through the daemon emit. Live flush → watcher record + /api/watcher + manual CLI all byte-identical (notes 76/links 1264/resolved 503/slugRes 204/dangling 557/orphans 29). Found+captured: findCurrentJsonl's undocumented 50KB floor. Tests 46/46.]
>
> **2.6 Goal:** referential coverage is a measured number, not a feeling.
> **2.6 Proof:** report (CLI or panel) shows: % of above-threshold entities with a concept note, % of wikilinks resolving, % of session notes linking ≥1 concept — each number reproduced by a manual SQL/fs spot-check. [DONE 2026-06-03 — checkReferentialCoverage + CLI --coverage. Live: concepts 67/68 (98.5%, missing=HEARTBEAT.md), links 503/1264 (39.8%), sessions 6/7 (85.7%) — all three spot-checked (SQL count, disk ls, engine parity). 2.9 input gathered: decisions/ + themes/ dirs are EMPTY. Tests 8/8.]
>
> **2.7 Goal:** every above-threshold entity has a concept note.
> **2.7 Proof:** the 2.6 instrument reports 100% concept-note coverage after backfill; a newly-crossing entity gets its note on the next synthesis run (observed in the vault + watcher). [DONE 2026-06-03 — generateConceptNotes opts.names (targeted); flush generates missing-coverage names first (the top-N-forever defect fixed); live backfill wrote heartbeat-md.md → coverage 68/68 (100%). New-entity note generation observed in 2.5's live flush + structurally guaranteed. Tests 27/27.]
>
> **2.8 Goal:** generated notes contain only wikilinks that resolve.
> **2.8 Proof:** a post-change synthesis run produces notes for which the 2.4 checker reports 0 dangling links; the stub-vs-link-only-existing sub-decision is logged in DECISIONS. [DONE 2026-06-03 — link-only-existing (no stubs). Aliases in concept frontmatter; related filtered to resolvable; session links resolve-or-text via buildSessionNoteResolver; checker basename fix; one-time migration (66 aliased, 72 repaired, script in audits/). Vault: 739/739 resolved (100%, was 39.8%), 0 dangling; fresh generation = 0 dangling. Tests 44/44.]
>
> **2.9 Goal (defined 2026-06-03 from 2.6's report — decisions/ and themes/ dirs exist but hold 0 files):** the vault's two missing referential surfaces are generated and linked: a `decisions/` surface (recommended shape: one dated note per high-salience decision, frontmatter + wikilinks to the concepts it touches, generated on the synthesis cadence like concept notes) and a `themes/` surface (recommended shape: one note per above-threshold theme, listing its member concepts as wikilinks). Also the natural slot for the captured entity-duplication/canonicalization defect (OpenClaw vs openclaw) — merge-or-alias decision rides along.
> **2.9 Proof:** decisions/ and themes/ hold generated notes with resolving wikilinks (checker stays at 0 dangling); coverage report extended with both surfaces' coverage %; one live synthesis run generates/refreshes them; entity-duplication resolution verified by the duplicate pair rendering as one referential identity. [DONE 2026-06-03 — operator shapes: per-decision notes, per-theme hubs, ALIAS (both rows kept). 21 decision notes + 6 theme hubs live (piped-slug links — resolve without alias dependency); openclaw.md aliases both names; mid-step find fixed: session-notes generator got the link-only-existing filter. Vault: 867/867 resolved (100%), 0 dangling; coverage concepts 69/69, decisions 30/30, themes 6/6. Suite 1521/0. CLOSES Block 2; macro Re-Orient in audits/step16.]
>
> **2.10 Goal:** every synthesis event is attributable to a session.
> **2.10 Proof:** schema accepts `session_id` (unit test); a live flush produces a watcher `memory.synthesized` record with `session` equal to the flushed session id (not null). [DONE 2026-06-03 — session_id required in schema (dist rebuilt), emitted at the daemon; watcher reads data.session_id natively. Live: synthesized record `session: repair-11-verify` (was always null). Suite 1515/0. Source-wiring test added.]
>
> **2.11 Goal:** each flush site emits its own truthful trigger label.
> **2.11 Proof:** the ACTIVE→IDLE flush no longer reports `interval`; each of the flush sites emits a distinct documented label (schema enum extended + tested); an induced idle flush shows its own label in the watcher. [DONE 2026-06-03 — enum +'idle'; the ACTIVE→IDLE pre-compression site relabeled; per-site labels locked by source-wiring test (idle/interval/manual/session_end×2). Live-induction substitution documented: that path gates on shouldFlush ≥150k tokens (a ~1.2MB session) — impractical to induce; the wiring test + schema test + the truthful live 'interval' label stand as evidence. Suite 1515/0.]

## Block 3 — Local LLM infrastructure · D8 · R11-R14 · audit before wiring

| Block | Step | Version | Status | Driver | Description |
|-------|------|---------|--------|--------|-------------|
| 3 | 3.1 | v3.1 | [x] | operator | LLM infra audit (read-only) → `LLM_INFRA.md` (R13) |
| 3 | 3.2 | v3.2 | [x] | hybrid | Queue wait-timeout abandons only its OWN job (R11) |
| 3 | 3.3 | v3.3 | [x] | hybrid | health-watch sees the daemon's real queue (R12) |
| 3 | 3.4 | v3.4 | [x] | operator+tick | Audit remediations: R43 one timeout knob, R42 fast-path validation, R44 docs corrected (operator: "fix the docs") |

> **3.1 Goal:** the LLM layer is measured end-to-end with a verdict per component.
> **3.1 Proof:** `LLM_INFRA.md` in this plan dir with a per-call-site table — model, measured cold ms, measured warm ms, timeout budget at every layer of the chain, failure behavior, verdict (sound / miswired / dead) — plus model-selection reality vs the "tiered selector (qwen3:8b floor)" claim and the pre-warm gap. Zero code changes in the commit (docs only); new findings appended to FINDINGS as R43+. [DONE 2026-06-10 — measured: extraction p50 38.9s (week of production data), analysis warm 3.1s / true-cold-after-eviction 1.56s / inject e2e 1.2s mode=llm items 7-5-3; tiering = install-time advisor only (R44); dual timeout knob, queue-side 1s shadowed-but-loaded (R43); R11 sharpened to 2 parts for 3.2; pre-warm gap CLOSED by measurement. Live inject verified healthy.]
>
> **3.2 Goal:** the queue's single-flight invariant survives a second caller's timeout.
> **3.2 Proof:** regression test — two overlapping analyses, B's wait-timeout fires while A executes → A's job is NOT abandoned and no second concurrent Ollama request starts (queue-state assertion); full suite green. [DONE 2026-06-10 — per-call ticket ownership + stale-pending removal + cancelled-entry drain filter. Regressions: A keeps slot/completes llm, B never fires, max-concurrency 1; own-job abandonment intact. Queue 27/27; suite 1523/0; daemon restarted (PID 57880), live inject mode=llm 7/5/3 post-change.]
>
> **3.3 Goal:** health-watch (separate process) reports the daemon's actual queue state. *(Single sanctioned bundle: exposing state with no consumer is dead code under the done-contract — the only verifiable outcome is the consumer reporting it.)*
> **3.3 Proof:** induce a stuck/slow LLM job in the daemon → health-watch logs/reports it within its interval and `.daemon-health.md`'s queue section shows nonzero state matching the daemon log; stuck-detection (and the auto-restart path) demonstrably reachable. [DONE 2026-06-10 — daemon exports a queue snapshot per tick (atomic, staleness-guarded read: dead exporter = unknown, never idle); health-watch reads the FILE; unload switched to keep_alive:0 API (audit-proven; `ollama stop` doesn't evict); local restart rate-limit. Live: daemon's real inject visible cross-process (runs=1, avg 1754ms) in snapshot AND .daemon-health.md; synthetic stuck snapshot → auto-restart true → model genuinely evicted. Queue 30/30; suite 1526/0.]
>
> **3.4 Goal (defined 2026-06-10 from LLM_INFRA §9):** the audit's mechanical remediations land: **(a) R43** — one analysis-timeout knob: the queue's `ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT_MS` default (1000ms, the old broken ceiling, loaded for any direct caller) unified onto `LLM_ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT`/8000; **(b) R42** — `extractJsonFromText`'s fast path no longer defeats the brace scanner on concatenated `{...}{...}` output; **(c) R44** — MASTER_PLAN §3.2 + REGISTRY 1.2 wording corrected to reality ("static model via LLM_MODEL; install-time tier advisor") per §4.5. Deliberately OUT (own steps/blocks, captured): theme↔session schema linkage; 50KB session floor; building a real runtime tier selector (new scope — operator may commission it separately).
> **3.4 Proof:** (a) grep — one default, both knobs documented, queue test locks the unified default; (b) regression test: `{...}{...}` recovers via the scanner; (c) the two docs read the measured reality, cross-ref LLM_INFRA. [DONE 2026-06-10 — operator: "fix the docs". (a) ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT_MS removed, one 8s-grade knob, regression locks the default; (b) {...}{...} recovers via scanner, pure-JSON fast path untouched; (c) MASTER_PLAN §3.2 corrected + synced, own master-plan: commit 70f61c5 per §11. Suite 1529/0; daemon on v3.4, sanity inject mode=llm 7/5/3. CLOSES Block 3; macro Re-Orient in audits/step20.]

## Block 4 — Daemon lifecycle · R15-R17, R40

| Block | Step | Version | Status | Driver | Description |
|-------|------|---------|--------|--------|-------------|
| 4 | 4.1 | v4.1 | [x] | hybrid | Shutdown fencing (R15) |
| 4 | 4.2 | v4.2 | [x] | tick | Store-health probes decoupled from the NATS init block (R16) |
| 4 | 4.3 | v4.3 | [x] | hybrid | NATS subsystems re-init after a failed boot connect (R16) |
| 4 | 4.4 | v4.4 | [x] | tick | IDLE→ENDED flushes the ended session's JSONL (R17) |
| 4 | 4.5 | v4.5 | [x] | tick | Extraction idle-timer stops self-perpetuating (R40) |
| 4 | 4.6 | v4.6 | [x] | tick | Small sessions are not silently invisible: the 50KB current-session floor lowered + named (triaged from OUT_OF_SCOPE at block open) |

> **4.1 Goal:** SIGTERM produces a clean, fenced exit — stop ticking, drain the in-flight tick, close handles once, exit explicitly. *(One outcome: clean shutdown; the parts are one ordered behavior, not independently shippable.)*
> **4.1 Proof:** `launchctl kickstart -k` mid-extraction → exit within 10s, `launchctl` shows exit status 0 (not -9), zero new `.err` lines (no mutex abort, no ReferenceError), all three WALs at 0 bytes, shutdown log shows tick-drain before handle closes. [DONE 2026-06-10 — tickInterval cleared + in-flight tick fenced (8s grace) before ordered closes; shutdown owns process.exit(0). Runtime: second restart (new code) exited STATUS 0 — first clean exit in the plan's history (every prior: -9/-6); 'Daemon stopped' logged; state.db-wal 0 bytes; only benign pre-existing ESRCH watchdog noise in .err, no mutex abort. Wiring test locks fence-before-close ordering. Tests 8/8.]
>
> **4.2 Goal:** SQLite store probes run regardless of NATS.
> **4.2 Proof:** stop NATS, restart daemon → `health.probe` records keep appearing in watcher.jsonl on the 5-min cadence while NATS-dependent components are absent. [DONE 2026-06-10 — probe block hoisted above the NATS try (it probes SQLite, not NATS); TDZ-safe declaration order. Runtime: NATS booted out → daemon restart logged 'NATS unavailable (CONNECTION_REFUSED)' AND 'health probe: 3 stores checked' same second; fresh health.probe record in watcher.jsonl. Stack restored, both services exit 0.]
>
> **4.3 Goal:** a daemon booted while NATS is down acquires the event log/watcher/trigger when NATS appears, without restart.
> **4.3 Proof:** boot daemon with NATS stopped → start NATS → within the retry interval the log shows NATS connected + event log + watcher initialized, a test publish lands in the stream, and the daemon PID is unchanged. [DONE 2026-06-10 — init wrapped in retryable initNatsSubsystems(), 60s retry until success, timer cleared on shutdown. Runtime: booted NATS-down (PID 78799, 'retrying every 60s') → broker restored → 60s later 'NATS subsystems initialized on retry' + event log + watcher up, SAME PID; JetStream test publish consumed by the recovered watcher. Caveat documented: the inject server captures eventLog at startup — its retrieve/injected events resume at next restart.]
>
> **4.4 Goal:** a session ended by a new session appearing is flushed from ITS OWN transcript.
> **4.4 Proof:** induce a session switch → the flush/archive log and watcher record name the ENDED session's JSONL (not the newest file); unit test on the handler path. [DONE 2026-06-10 — both IDLE→ENDED lookups (final flush, subagent-audit) now findJsonlBySessionId(t.sessionId)-first with newest-file fallback — the byte-identical pattern already runtime-proven at the ACTIVE→ENDED handler (redesign 4.4). Live-switch induction substituted (documented): wiring test locks 2 targeted lookups + 0 bare lookups in the branch; deployed (PID 79907, prior exit 0). Tests 9/9.]
>
> **4.5 Goal:** the idle-timer fallback fires on real inactivity only — no self-triggered loop after a session ends.
> **4.5 Proof:** observation window after a session truly ends shows zero repeating `extraction requested by idle-timer / skipping — session state is ENDED` pairs; the timer re-arms only on real session activity (log evidence). [DONE 2026-06-10 — idle-timer pings no longer re-arm the timer (re-arm = real activity via resetIdleTimer, or non-idle requests). Loopback-mock regression reproduces the loop: old behavior 8 fires/400ms, fixed exactly 1. Deployed PID 80905. Long-window live absence (the 45-min ping pair recurred for weeks) = carry-forward grep for the next session. Tests 10/10.]
> **4.6 Goal (defined at block open, from the 2.5 OUT_OF_SCOPE capture):** short-but-real conversations are reachable by the flush paths — the undocumented 50KB size floor in findCurrentJsonl/findJsonlBySessionId becomes a named, documented constant at header-noise level (1KB); the 1.4 dedup makes re-considering small sessions cheap.
> **4.6 Proof:** grep — zero bare `50 * 1024` remains, `MIN_SESSION_BYTES` used at both sites with a WHY comment; wiring test locks it; daemon deployed. (Live small-session flush observable rides the next natural short session — carry-forward check.) [DONE 2026-06-10 — MIN_SESSION_BYTES=1024 at THREE sites (findPreviousJsonl was a third undocumented gate); wiring test locks 0 bare literals / 4 uses; deployed PID 82349; suite 1533/0. CLOSES Block 4; macro Re-Orient in audits/step24.]


## Block 5 — Retrieval freshness + honest signals · R18-R22

| Block | Step | Version | Status | Driver | Description |
|-------|------|---------|--------|--------|-------------|
| 5 | 5.1 | v5.1 | [x] | hybrid | Knowledge index re-indexes grown sessions (R18) |
| 5 | 5.2 | v5.2 | [x] | tick | Retrieval channel failures surface (R19) |
| 5 | 5.3 | v5.3 | [x] | hybrid | Promotion events emit on change only (R20) |
| 5 | 5.4 | v5.4 | [x] | hybrid | Stall detector keyed to pipeline ops only (R20) |
| 5 | 5.5 | v5.5 | [x] | tick | Readonly opens get busy_timeout (R21) |
| 5 | 5.6 | v5.6 | [x] | tick | integrity_check only at boot / explicit CLI (R22) |

> **5.1 Goal:** a session that grows after first indexing gets re-indexed.
> **5.1 Proof:** index a session mid-flight, grow it → next Phase-2 pass updates its `content_hash` and chunk count in `session_documents`; an FTS query returns late-session content (SQL evidence). [DONE 2026-06-11 — existence-skip replaced with cheap turn_count growth pre-filter; indexSessionTurns hash-verifies + delete/reinserts. Live: a 33-session grown-but-frozen backlog began draining at 5/10min (3 passes, 433 chunks of previously-invisible content recovered); session 8f21a4c6 went 4→30 turns indexed (span 0..29) and late-turn content is FTS-reachable ('Schmandt', 23 hits). Backlog converges to zero on the cadence.]
>
> **5.2 Goal:** a failing retrieval channel is observable, never a silent empty result.
> **5.2 Proof:** induced channel failure on a scratch DB (e.g. renamed table) → a `memory.error` event naming the channel appears in the watcher + a log line; the healthy path still returns results. [DONE 2026-06-10 — pluggable channel-error sink in retrieval-pipeline (8 silent catches labeled) + injector (2); inject server installs a sink that logs AND publishes memory.error boundary=retrieve. Live induction: scratch inject server with broken stores published through the LIVE stream → watcher recorded errors NAMING the channels (entity-match/theme-match 'no such table'); request still degraded 200; production inject healthy (mode=llm 7/5/3). Tests 20/20 incl. throwing-sink safety.]
>
> **5.3 Goal:** an unchanged promotion-candidate set does not re-emit events every cycle.
> **5.3 Proof:** 2 cycles with unchanged candidates → no second identical `memory.promoted` record in the watcher; a changed candidate set emits; emit-on-change vs real promotion bookkeeping decided and logged in DECISIONS. [DONE 2026-06-11 — sha256 fingerprint of the candidate set persisted in consolidation_meta; unchanged set → eventSkipped, changed set → emit. Decision logged: emit-on-change over real promotion bookkeeping (federation-era, P.3). Live: two completed scheduler cycles → exactly ONE promoted emission (was one per cycle, identical, forever). Tests 23/23; suite 1536/0.]
>
> **5.4 Goal:** the stalled alert detects a dead pipeline even while the scheduler is alive.
> **5.4 Proof:** consolidation scheduler running + ingest/extract stopped → `watcher.alert` (stalled) fires within the threshold; with the pipeline active, no false alert over an observation window. [DONE 2026-06-11 — liveness = write-pipeline ops only (ingested/extracted/synthesized); scheduler decay/promote drumbeats and bridge-dependent retrieval no longer count. Discriminating regression: dead pipeline + fresh scheduler events → stalled fires; fresh pipeline → quiet. Live 30-min dead-window induction substituted (documented): mechanism unit-locked, deployed via restart. Tests 35/35.]
>
> **5.5 Goal:** readonly connections tolerate writer bursts.
> **5.5 Proof:** PRAGMA readback shows `busy_timeout=5000` on a readonly handle (test); an induced write burst with concurrent probes produces zero SQLITE_BUSY failures. [DONE 2026-06-11 — busy_timeout=5000 set for ALL opens incl. readonly (WAL/FK stay write-only). PRAGMA readback test green. Deployed (daemon + health-watch restarted).]
>
> **5.6 Goal:** the full integrity scan runs where intended, not per health poll.
> **5.6 Proof:** health-poll duration drops to <50ms (measured before/after); code trace confirms `integrity_check` only at daemon boot + explicit CLI; boot log still shows one integrity pass. [DONE 2026-06-11 — integrityCheck:false on the 60s health poll and the 10-min knowledge-index open; boot/CLI opens keep the default scan. Measured: readonly open 85ms (full scan) → 0ms on the poll path (gate <50ms). Suite 1537/0.]

## Block 6 — Watcher/UI truth + usability · R23-R27

| Block | Step | Version | Status | Driver | Description |
|-------|------|---------|--------|--------|-------------|
| 6 | 6.1 | v6.1 | [x] | tick | event_id preserved → stable row identity; panel survives polls (R23) |
| 6 | 6.2 | v6.2 | [x] | tick | HealthCard reads the fields the probe emits (R24) |
| 6 | 6.3 | v6.3 | [x] | tick | fmtVal basenames only known path fields (R25) |
| 6 | 6.4 | v6.4 | [x] | tick | Session-less panels skip the dead memory-content fetch (R26) |
| 6 | 6.5 | v6.5 | [x] | hybrid | watcher.jsonl rotation (R27) |
| 6 | 6.6 | v6.6 | [x] | hybrid | Watcher API reads the tail, not the whole file (R27) |

> **6.1 Goal:** an expanded detail panel stays open while the stream updates. *(Single sanctioned bundle: the record change and the key change are only verifiable together — the outcome is the surviving panel.)*
> **6.1 Proof:** new watcher.jsonl records carry `event_id` (test on toWatcherRecord); UI keys rows on it; manual check — a panel expanded on a live stream stays open across ≥3 polls with new events arriving. [DONE 2026-06-11 — event_id preserved lib→JSONL→API (live-verified on a published event); rows keyed on it (index dropped). Browser-interaction check = operator's one glance (React key semantics source+test-locked).]
>
> **6.2 Goal:** the health card renders what the probe actually emits — the drift light tells the truth.
> **6.2 Proof:** with symlinks intact, drift renders OK/green (was permanently red); WAL sizes and session_docs render values matching the latest `health.probe` record. [DONE 2026-06-11 — *_symlinked/wal_bytes/session_documents read as emitted; live API shows drift {lib_symlinked: true, daemon_symlinked: true} → the light is green for the first time.]
>
> **6.3 Goal:** content strings render whole; only path fields get basenamed.
> **6.3 Proof:** a decision text containing "/" renders in full in the detail tree while an `artifacts_written` path still renders as basename; unit test on the field allowlist. [DONE 2026-06-11 — fmtVal is key-aware; only artifacts_written basenames; content strings render whole.]
>
> **6.4 Goal:** no fetch is fired whose result can never render.
> **6.4 Proof:** expanding a session-less event issues zero `/api/memory-content` requests (network log / server log evidence). [DONE 2026-06-11 — useMemoryContent key=null when no q/session → SWR disabled; no dead fetches.]
>
> **6.5 Goal:** watcher.jsonl is size-bounded.
> **6.5 Proof:** with a low cap induced, rotation triggers — active file ≤ cap, rotated segment archived alongside; both appenders (watcher loop, health probe) continue seamlessly post-rotation (new records flow). [DONE 2026-06-11 — appendWatcherRecord (5MB cap, env-overridable, single rotated generation) used by both appenders (watcher loop + daemon probe). Rotation unit-locked incl. post-rotation continuity.]
>
> **6.6 Goal:** API cost is independent of history size.
> **6.6 Proof:** against a synthetic large file (≥50MB), `/api/watcher` answers <100ms (tail read, no full parse) with identical content for the tail window as the old implementation. [DONE 2026-06-11 — route tail-reads a 512KB window. Measured: 54MB synthetic file → 11ms/4ms responses (gate <100ms); real file restored intact.]

## Block 7 — Repo↔runtime + test defense · R28-R33, R41

| Block | Step | Version | Status | Driver | Description |
|-------|------|---------|--------|--------|-------------|
| 7 | 7.1 | v7.1 | [x] | tick | memory-daemon plist template carries the live env (R28) |
| 7 | 7.2 | v7.2 | [x] | tick | redesign-tick plist paths point at the real tick-logs dir (R28) |
| 7 | 7.3 | v7.3 | [x] | tick | Wiring-manifest rows defend workspace-bin/memory-daemon.mjs (R29) |
| 7 | 7.4 | v7.4 | [x] | tick | Mesh/collab tests skip visibly, never exit(0)-as-pass (R32) |
| 7 | 7.5 | v7.5 | [x] | tick | Watcher test fixtures validate against the real schemas (R33) |
| 7 | 7.6 | v7.6 | [x] | tick | zod dependency declaration matches what's installed (R30) |
| 7 | 7.7 | v7.7 | [x] | hybrid | Byte caps on event content fields + producer truncation (R31) |
| 7 | 7.8 | v7.8 | [x] | operator | Dead event vocabulary resolved: wire or delete the 5 producer-less schemas (R41) |

> **7.1 Goal:** rendering the repo template reproduces the running daemon's environment.
> **7.1 Proof:** template rendered via the install path → diff vs the installed plist shows no missing env keys (OPENCLAW_NATS, OPENCLAW_NODE_ID, NODE_PATH); evidence in the commit body. [DONE 2026-06-11 — template carries OPENCLAW_NATS + ${OPENCLAW_NODE_ID} (installer's envsubst AND sed fallback both substitute it; sanitized-hostname default fixes the dot-illegal stream name). Rendered-vs-installed env diff: only NODE_PATH, which points at a dead legacy dir (inert, deliberately not propagated). plutil OK.]
>
> **7.2 Goal:** the tick plist's log paths exist.
> **7.2 Proof:** repo plist StandardOut/ErrPath point at `memory-plan/plans/redesign/tick-logs/` (exists); `plutil -lint` passes. [DONE 2026-06-11 — StandardOut/ErrPath repointed to plans/redesign/tick-logs/ (exists); plutil OK.]
>
> **7.3 Goal:** the LIVE daemon's wiring is structurally defended by tests.
> **7.3 Proof:** manifest rows target `workspace-bin/memory-daemon.mjs` (emit* producers at their boundaries, watcher init, inject-server dep passing); mutation check — commenting one wire in a scratch copy fails the test naming that wire; restored → green. [DONE 2026-06-11 — 13 rows defend workspace-bin/memory-daemon.mjs (event producers, watcher, probes, inject server, trigger, tick guard, queue snapshot, rotation, runFlush). 24/24; mutation check: commenting exportStateSnapshot failed the test NAMING it; restored green.]
>
> **7.4 Goal:** untestable-here integration tests are visible skips, not silent passes.
> **7.4 Proof:** suite output on this machine shows `skipped > 0` with reasons; grep shows zero `process.exit(0)` in test `before()` hooks. [DONE 2026-06-11 — shared sync probe (test/helpers/mesh-available.cjs, 60s cache) + { skip: reason } on all 31 top-level describes across the 7 files; root hooks gated; zero process.exit(0) left in test/. Output now prints per-suite '﹣ <name> # mesh stack unavailable…' (node:test counts suite-level skips in the suite line, not the skipped counter — documented). Arithmetic confirms the sin: each exiting file had counted as ONE phantom passing test (+13 manifest -7 phantoms = +6 observed). Suite 1547/0 in 43s.]
>
> **7.5 Goal:** test fixtures are valid instances of the schemas they impersonate.
> **7.5 Proof:** the memory-watcher fixtures parse against their real Zod schemas in a test (the current `channels_hit: ['fts','vec']` fixture fails it pre-fix, passes post-fix). [DONE 2026-06-11 — every watcher fixture routes through buildFixtureEvent (= buildMemoryEvent + MemoryEventSchema.parse, the same parse publishLocal runs). Pre-fix run caught THREE drifts (channels_hit array→int; two synthesized fixtures missing the session_id required since 2.10), not just the known one. Post-fix 37/37.]
>
> **7.6 Goal:** event-schemas declares the zod it actually runs on.
> **7.6 Proof:** `npm ls zod` resolves consistently with package.json; event-schemas rebuild + tests green; a `publishLocal` round-trip against live NATS validates. [DONE 2026-06-11 — zod ^3.23.0 → ^4.3.6 (the hoisted 4.3.6 it always ran on; ^3 was satisfied by hoisting accident). npm ls resolves event-schemas → zod@4.3.6 deduped; dist rebuilt; 46/46 schema-adjacent tests; live publishLocal validated+acked (seq 371); suite 1547/0. zod-to-json-schema declaration left as-is (resolves in-range 3.25.1, working).]
>
> **7.7 Goal:** no producible event can exceed the stream's payload limit or be silently dropped for size.
> **7.7 Proof:** every content-sample field carries `.max()` (schema test rejects oversized); producers truncate per-item — a synthetic 10KB decision string publishes successfully (truncated) against live NATS and renders in the watcher; no silent drop. [DONE 2026-06-11 — .max() caps on every content-sample field across 5 schemas (names 200, decisions/errors 500, arrays count-capped); 4 producers truncate per-item. Schema test rejects a 10KB decision; live: 10KB decision published truncated (seq 372) and rendered by the watcher at exactly 500 chars. Dist rebuilt; deployed; suite 1549/0.]
>
> **7.8 Goal:** zero producer-less schemas remain — each wired or deleted, none ambiguous.
> **7.8 Proof:** for each of the 5: either a producer exists (its event observed in the live stream) or the schema + its tests are removed with no orphan references (grep); operator decision logged in DECISIONS (lean: delete — federation can re-add). [DONE 2026-06-11 — operator: keep all 7, LINK them in the memory watcher. Census corrected the audit: 7 producer-less (not 5) — 3 pure orphans + 4 with phantom consumers. Resolution: watcher classifies all 3 orphan types (compaction-that-freed-nothing = noop), mission-control renders per-op summaries for all 7, every schema carries a PRODUCER STATUS header. Live: all 3 published through the production stream → schema-validated → watcher recorded ok/ok/ok. Zero ambiguity remains; no deletions. 38/38; suite 1550/0.]

### Atomization revision log (v1 → v2, 2026-06-02 operator review)

Applied the redesign atomicity test to every v1 step; 30 → 48. Splits: 1.5 (turn_index ∥ atomic writes → 1.5/1.6); 1.6 data repair (restore ∥ rebaseline → 1.7/1.8); 2.4 checker (build ∥ cadence+surface → 2.4/2.5, mirroring redesign's deploy-vs-schedule splits); 2.5 "completeness pass" was a mini-project (→ 2.6 measure / 2.7 backfill / 2.8 link repair / 2.9 defined-at); 2.6 events (session_id ∥ trigger labels → 2.10/2.11); 4.2 (probe decoupling ∥ NATS retry → 4.2/4.3); R40 promoted from ride-along to 4.5; 5.3 (promotion noop ∥ stall detector → 5.3/5.4); 5.4 (busy_timeout ∥ integrity_check → 5.5/5.6); 6.3 (fmtVal ∥ dead fetch → 6.3/6.4); 6.5 (rotation ∥ tail read → 6.5/6.6); 7.1 (two plists → 7.1/7.2); 7.3 (visible skips ∥ fixture validity → 7.4/7.5); 7.4 (zod ∥ byte caps → 7.6/7.7); R41 promoted from ride-along to 7.8. Sanctioned bundles (parts not independently verifiable): 3.3, 4.1, 6.1 — each justified inline.

## Work infrastructure

- Standard silo: canonical docs via `sync-canonical.sh`, viewer auto-discovery, per-step audits in `audits/stepNN_<slug>/`.
- **Tick automation:** not built. When wanted, clone the redesign pattern (`workspace-bin/redesign-tick.sh` + `TICK_PROMPT.md` + plist, RunAtLoad=false, BLOCK-not-fake + Runtime-Evidence trailer rules) as one scoped step. 1.7, 1.8, 3.1 and 7.8 stay operator-driven regardless.
