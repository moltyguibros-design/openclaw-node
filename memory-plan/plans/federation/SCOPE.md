# SCOPE — federation plan

**Status:** idle
**Closed at:** 2026-08-24 — the 2.6 disposition batch below completed and its window expired
2026-08-09; the header was left reading `active` while `Expires` had passed, which blocks every
write rather than allowing any. Returned to `idle` so it reflects reality and one-scope-per-session
discipline holds. Federation itself remains BLOCKED per D15/BLOCKED.md — this changes scope
bookkeeping only, not the plan's blocked status.
**Goal:** Operator "gogo" 2026-08-03: execute the reopened 2.6 premise benchmark per D14 —
resume from the v2.6-pre design (five comparable tasks, same advanced LLM/tools per arm, blind
scoring, cost recorded). Phase 1 of the step is the D11 worker-readiness pre-screen: 3
claude-provider mesh-agents up and observable, wedge-risk smoked on a THROWAWAY task (never one
of the five — D14 forbids substitution during the rerun). Task slate confirmation and blind
scoring remain operator gates. Harness/agent/CLI fixes allowed ONLY where the pre-screen proves
them broken. Steps 6.2/6.3 gates unaffected.
**Addendum 2026-08-05 (operator "go" — 2.6 disposition):** close step 2.6 with the final
two-run verdict (PREMISE NOT EVIDENCED), place the D3 block on the plan (BLOCKED.md), record
the verdict + redesign-door decision (D15), and carry VERSION to v2.6. Governance/docs only —
no code, no further executions. Files under "26-disposition".
**Set at:** 2026-08-03 (operator "gogo"; prior idle header set 2026-08-02 during governance
recovery; refreshed 2026-08-05 for the disposition batch — the run-scope expired at 00:00Z)
**Expires:** 2026-08-09T00:00:00Z

## Retired scope history

The former 2026-07-16 scope carried 85 open allow-list entries across abandoned and unfinished
batches. Those writable blocks are retired, not represented as shipped. Their history remains in
git and `audits/`; unfinished outcomes are represented by INVENTORY statuses and contracts.

## Reopen rule

Open exactly one new labeled `files` block only after operator approval. The next recommended
scope is 2.6 evidence execution, not management Block 4.
