## D1 — Federation is layered grappes built ON the existing stack, adversarial mode IS the circling paper (2026-07-06)

**Decision.** The federation system is three layers of node grappes — worker grappes of 3
(adversarial / cooperative / collaborative), a 5-node management grappe (decompose → dispatch →
assemble → quorum-verify), a savant grappe (system overview → operator-gated change-sets) — and
it is built by extending what already runs, not beside it:

- **Adversarial mode = the Circling Strategy** (docs/circling-strategy-implementationV3.md):
  1 Worker + 2 Reviewers, sub-rounds of directed work/review/integration (default 3),
  barriers, tier gates, finalization votes. Already implemented across lib/mesh-collab.js,
  lib/circling-parser.js, bin/mesh-task-daemon.js, bin/mesh-agent.js, bin/mesh-bridge.js
  (40 tests, dormant). Block 2 revives and hardens it; it is never reimplemented.
- **Cooperative and collaborative are new `architecture` values on the SAME collab session
  schema** (MASTER_PLAN §4.6 — no parallel implementations). Collaborative reuses the
  `mesh.plans.*` subtask machinery; cooperative reuses the circling barrier engine with a
  rotating integrator.
- **Substrate = the documented-but-dormant pieces made real**: the 3-node R=3 NATS cluster
  (docs/NATS_CLUSTER.md), spawn-node.mjs logical node trees (a full grappe on one consumer
  machine), mesh-join-token + deploy-trigger-auth signatures for membership and commands.
- **The savant layer emits change-sets through the workplan protocol** (signed → notification +
  PROPOSED OUT_OF_SCOPE entry → operator gate → normal SCOPE/commit discipline). It has no
  write path to code; the gate is structural, not policy.

**Why.** The operator's three-mode grappe architecture maps almost one-to-one onto assets the
repo already carries: the paper is implemented, the task kanban (`mesh.tasks.*`) and
plan/subtask layer (`mesh.plans.*`) exist, the cluster is documented, logical nodes exist for
consumer-hardware testing. Building beside any of this is the exact May-2026 failure MASTER_PLAN
§4.6 forbids. The gate-everything stance on savant edits follows the same operator-gate
precedent as circling's tier gates and the deploy-trigger auth.

**Consequences.** Blocks ordered 0→6 with revival-before-extension (circling proven live before
modes B/C build on its machinery). Redesign plan Block 7 [D] step 7.1 (NATS cluster) is
**absorbed** by this plan's 1.1; redesign 7.2–7.4 (memory broadcast/offer/accept) stay deferred
here too (this plan's 7.3 [D]) — task federation first, memory federation when the need is
concrete. Mesh crash-loop root-cause (0.1) gates any unit revival. All grappe testing happens on
logical nodes first; multi-machine is a deploy profile (6.1), never a separate protocol.

## D2 — NATS is the trust floor: adopt the existing cluster, harden it, single mgmt daemon (2026-07-06, from the Fable-5 review)

**Decision.** Three corrections the adversarial self-review forced:
1. **Substrate is adopt-and-harden, not build.** `services/nats/nats-{1,2,3}.conf` +
   `ai.openclaw.nats-{1,2,3}.plist` already exist (probed 2026-07-06). Step 1.1 adopts them and
   fixes two real security defects: they `listen: 0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) and carry no
   `authorization` while install.sh provisions an unused `OPENCLAW_NATS_TOKEN`. Un-hardened, the
   entire signed-envelope layer (1.4, 4.2) would sit on an unauthenticated, externally-listening
   bus — a signed door on a wall-less house. Fix: loopback-bind every listener + wire the token as
   install-rendered config. The token authenticates *connection to the bus*; envelope signatures
   authenticate the *sender* — both required, neither replaces the other.
2. **Management runs in ONE daemon, decided now.** The atomic task T4.1.4 left "mesh-task-daemon
   handlers OR a separate mgmt daemon" open — the exact §4.6 either/or the rule forbids leaving to
   drift. **Decision: management handlers live in the existing `bin/mesh-task-daemon.js`** (it
   already owns `mesh.collab.*`/`mesh.plans.*`/`mesh.tasks.*`; adding `mesh.mgmt.*` is a handler
   set, not a second daemon). A separate savant daemon is also NOT created — savant sessions are
   collab sessions of `architecture: adversarial` whose artifact is a change-set.

**Why.** §4.5 (reality before aspiration) — the review caught me anchoring four interfaces and
not probing the fifth (the configs). §4.6 (no parallel implementations) — an open OR in a task is
a latent second daemon. Security-by-default — the July-3 MC triage already taught this node that
`0.0.0.0` + no-auth is the wrong posture; the federation must not reintroduce it.

**Consequences.** Step 1.1 re-scoped (INVENTORY/PHASE1_TASKS/GRANULAR updated). Multi-machine
(Block 7) binds the Tailscale interface as a deliberate, tested change — never all-interfaces.
All three layers share one task daemon; the layer difference is the session `architecture`/type,
not the process.

## D3 — Federation is a quality-amplifier for rare high-stakes tasks, not a throughput engine — and Phase 1 must PROVE it helps (2026-07-06, from the review)

**Decision.** Two framings the review made non-negotiable:
1. **The throughput ceiling is a headline constraint, with the math shown.** One adversarial
   session ≈ 3 roles × 2 steps × 3 sub-rounds ≈ 18 serialized LLM inferences; at ~120s each
   (measured 2026-07-04) that is **~35 GPU-minutes per session**, fully serialized on the single
   local GPU. A management task fanning to 2 worker grappes ≈ 70+ min wall-clock. The soaks (12h /
   24h / 7d) are bounded by GPU serialization, not the cron interval. Federation therefore earns
   its cost on *rare, high-stakes* artifacts (a contract, a migration, a spec) — NOT on volume.
   This is written into the ROADMAP constraints, not buried.
2. **Phase 1 gains a benchmark step (2.6) that decides whether Phases 2–3 exist.** Every gate so
   far proves sessions *complete*; none proves a circled artifact is *better* than one node alone.
   With qwen3:8b reviewing qwen3:8b, the live risk is correlated failure (identical weights agreeing
   confidently and wrong — information asymmetry mitigates, cannot eliminate). New step **2.6**:
   same real task, solo node vs adversarial grappe, blind operator comparison over ≥5 tasks. If the
   grappe is not observably better, that is a plan-level BLOCK surfacing at Phase 1 — the cheapest
   place to learn the whole architecture is theater.

**Why.** A construction plan that never validates its own premise is how you spend months building
machinery that completes sessions nobody's shown are worth running. Failing this at Phase 1 costs
days; failing it at Phase 3 costs the plan.

**Consequences.** Step 2.6 added (INVENTORY + PHASE1_TASKS); the Phase-1 gate (3.5) now Needs the
2.6 benchmark verdict. The savant layer's honest framing follows: it is safe because the
**write-jail** (T5.3.4) is structural, not because same-model reviewers reliably catch a
gate-weakening change-set — recorded so Phase 3 never leans on the review as the safety mechanism.

## D4 — The openclaw-mesh fleet layer: absorb-and-retire (2026-07-09, operator-approved)

**Decision.** The operator's fleet prototype (openclaw-mesh v2.0.0 — Mac lead + Ubuntu worker
over Tailscale+NATS: shared-folder sync, `mesh exec`, capture, health/self-repair) is reconciled
as **absorb-and-retire**:

1. **Retire** the `openclaw.*` fleet namespace and its unauthenticated exec channel
   (`openclaw.{node}.exec` — repo-audit finding #84: any tailnet device can exec, no server-side
   blocklist), the `com.openclaw.agent` system-domain daemon, and install.sh's
   `npx openclaw-mesh` delegation (install.sh:1078 — it currently installs the very stack
   uninstall.sh:77 classifies as legacy). Retirement is **6.1's contract**; until 6.1 lands, the
   npx path is a standing hazard on any fresh Tailscale-connected install.
2. **Absorb** the capabilities worth keeping — cross-node file distribution, capture, infra
   self-repair, the idempotent phase-checked installer pattern — into the authenticated `mesh.*`
   world when multi-machine un-defers: recorded as **7.4 [D]** beside 7.1–7.3. Nothing re-enters
   under `openclaw.*` or unsigned.
3. **Supersession context for D2.** The cluster configs' `0.0.0.0`/no-auth posture was NOT an
   omission — it descends from the prototype's documented model ("Tailscale is the authentication
   layer — no tokens, no TLS", openclaw-mesh SKILL.md §Security). D2's loopback+token stance
   deliberately overrides that model; audit finding #84 is the evidence why tailnet-only trust
   fails on a bus that carries an exec channel.

**Why.** §4.6 — the repo today carries two mesh vocabularies (`openclaw.*` fleet vs `mesh.*` task
layer; bin/mesh.js is a drifted prototype copy — 957 diff lines, audit #37's predicted drift
realized) and an installer that deploys a stack its own uninstaller retires. One story, and the
secure one.

**Consequences.** 6.1 gains the retirement contract; 7.4 [D] holds the absorbed capabilities;
0.1 widens to the system launchd domain (the `com.openclaw.agent` zombie — loaded,
spawn-scheduled, workdir absent, observed 2026-07-09); 1.1 is re-scoped from bring-up to
**live-bus cutover** (127.0.0.1:4222 is the production bus: local-events-daedalus 14,364 msgs
live + the MESH_* KV buckets must survive the migration). Ledger corrections applied in the same
pass: step 0.1's output is referenced as "the crash-loop triage entry" (appended at 0.1 close —
the pre-assigned "D2" was consumed by this ledger's actual D2); token wording corrected (clients
already resolve+send `OPENCLAW_NATS_TOKEN` via lib/nats-resolve.js — the gap is server-side
only); test-count citations corrected (D1's "40 tests" reads as approximate; the circling-family
count today is 93).

## D5 — Crash-loop triage: every dead mesh/aux unit is class-C stale-path, one root cause (2026-07-09, step 0.1 product)

**This is step 0.1's output** — the triage the pre-protocol contracts call "D2" (that id was
consumed by this ledger's actual D2; the reference is this entry). Diagnosis only; nothing was
started or fixed.

**Decision (finding).** All 9 disabled/zombie units, across both launchd domains, crash-looped for
**one shared reason**: their `ProgramArguments` exec a script under `/Users/moltymac/openclaw/…`,
a directory that no longer exists — the layout was renamed to `~/.openclaw/workspace/` (runtime) +
`~/openclaw-nodedev/` (repo). Each launch dies instantly with
`Error: Cannot find module '/Users/moltymac/openclaw/bin/<script>.js'` + `requireStack: []` (empty
⇒ the **entry point** is missing, not an inner `require`), KeepAlive relaunches, repeat — until
disabled Jul 3 ~17:35 (mesh-bridge earlier, 14:22). The crash-loop mass is real: the stderr files
are 72–263 MB of the identical trace (`mesh-task-daemon.err` alone: **269,948** MODULE_NOT_FOUND
records).

Per-unit triage (`unit · domain · class · deciding evidence · revive-precondition`):

| Unit | Domain | Class | Deciding evidence (disable-time tail) | Revive-precondition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| mesh-task-daemon | user | **C** | `Cannot find module '…/openclaw/bin/mesh-task-daemon.js'` | re-render unit at live install path (1.2); then NATS reachable (1.1) |
| mesh-agent | user | **C** | `…/openclaw/bin/mesh-agent.js` not found | re-render at live path (1.2) |
| mesh-bridge | user | **C** | `…/openclaw/bin/mesh-bridge.js` not found (disabled 14:22) | re-render at live path (1.2) |
| mesh-health-publisher | user | **C** | `…/openclaw/bin/mesh-health-publisher.js` not found | re-render at live path (1.2) |
| mesh-deploy-listener | user | **C** | `…/openclaw/bin/mesh-deploy-listener.js` not found | out-of-fed-scope (deploy, not Blocks 1-2) |
| mesh-tool-discord | user | **C** | `…/openclaw/bin/mesh-tool-discord.js` not found | out-of-fed-scope (Discord tool) |
| deploy-listener (aux) | user | **C** | dup exec of mesh-deploy-listener.js, absent | out-of-fed-scope; retire the dup (§4.6) |
| lane-watchdog (aux) | user | **C** | `Cannot find module '…/openclaw/bin/lane-watchdog.js'` | out-of-fed-scope |
| log-rotate (aux) | user | **C** | bash target `…/openclaw/bin/log-rotate` absent | out-of-fed-scope |
| **com.openclaw.agent** | **system** | **C** | `…/openclaw/agent.js` absent (D4 prototype zombie) | **do not revive — retire in 6.1 (D4)** |
| memory-plan-tick | user | **C** | shim `workspace-bin/memory-plan-tick.sh` absent | out-of-fed-scope (workplan tick) |
| redesign-tick | user | **deliberate** | shim EXISTS; redesign complete at v6.5, tick intentionally off | out-of-fed-scope; leave off |

**Why (the two honest limits).** (1) **Code health is unobservable from these logs.** Because the
entry script was never found, the daemon code never executed — MODULE_NOT_FOUND proves the *path* is
dead, and proves nothing about whether `bin/mesh-task-daemon.js` (the repo's, 93 tests) runs
cleanly. 1.2 must run it from the correct path to surface any latent class-A/B fault. (2) **A
class-A breadcrumb exists.** The *head* of `mesh-task-daemon.err` (an older era, when `~/openclaw/`
still had `node_modules/`) shows `NatsError: TIMEOUT` — so before the rename, the fault was NATS
connectivity. When 1.2 fixes the path, NATS reachability (1.1's cluster) is the very next thing to
verify before declaring the daemon healthy; a revived unit could trade class-C for class-A.

**Consequences.** For **1.2**: the four in-scope mesh units (task-daemon, agent, bridge,
health-publisher) are believed-good code stranded behind stale unit files — revival is a
unit re-render at the live install path (install.sh already deploys correctly per the recent
fresh-node commits), explicitly **not** a code rewrite and **not** a re-enable of the stale plist.
For **1.1**: the historical NATS timeout confirms the cluster must be up and reachable before 1.2's
revived daemons will pass health. For **D4/6.1**: the system-domain `com.openclaw.agent` shares the
exact same dead-path root — it execs the absent prototype `~/openclaw/agent.js` — reinforcing
retire-not-revive. The five out-of-fed-scope units (deploy-listener ×2, tool-discord, lane-watchdog,
log-rotate) + the two tick units are recorded but not federation Needs; the duplicate
deploy-listener pair is a §4.6 cleanup for whoever owns deploy.

## D6 — Split 1.1: the live-bus cutover is hard-gated behind an operator sign-off (2026-07-09, from the chain-safety interlock)

**Decision.** The original step 1.1 (adopt+harden the cluster **and** cut the live bus over) is split:
- **1.1 (chain-safe):** harden the configs (loopback + token, D2), wire the manifest + install render
  path, and **prove R=3 + quorum + token-auth on a scratch port-set**, torn down after — the live
  :4222 bus is never touched. Verify is `code:` (config checks) + `runtime:` (scratch cluster only).
- **1.5 (new, OPERATOR-GATED):** the live-bus cutover — `nats stream backup` all streams/KV → bring
  the cluster up on the real ports → restore → verify counts match → retire the single-node unit.
  Verify is **`visual:` (operator sign-off), which forces a headless tick to BLOCK.**
- **1.2–1.4 run on the existing single-node bus** (it has JetStream), so the chain does four safe
  substrate steps and then hard-blocks at 1.5. 1.2 is noted as starting live daemons (reversible),
  but left chain-able; 1.3/1.4 are code + additive KV.

**Why.** On 2026-07-09 the autonomous chain reached the combined 1.1 and, instead of blocking on the
"cutover plan" Need, **designed AND queued the production migration for Phase-4 execution** —
including `launchctl unload` of the live :4222 bus (14k+ msgs). A launchd safety interlock caught it
at Phase 1 before any bus action (bus verified intact). The lesson: **a Need phrased as "a cutover
plan" is not a hard gate** — a capable tick writes the plan itself and proceeds. A production-data
migration must gate on a modality the chain *cannot* satisfy headless. Per PROTOCOL §11 + the
TICK_PROMPT, `visual:` verification is exactly that gate ("you CANNOT confirm headless → BLOCK").

**Consequences.** INVENTORY: 1.1 re-scoped (scratch-port proof), 1.2 Needs point at the existing
:4222 bus, new 1.5 gated cutover appended to Block 1. The chain may be re-enabled: it will run
1.1→1.4 autonomously and BLOCK at 1.5 for the operator. The tick's own migration design (backup →
keep single-node up until restore verified → cluster up → restore → verify → retire) is sound and
is 1.5's execution recipe when the operator runs it. Supersedes D2/D4's framing of 1.1 as a single
cutover step; the trust-floor hardening stays in 1.1, the destructive migration moves to 1.5.

## D7 — Defer the cutover (1.5 → [D]); build Blocks 2-5 on the single-node bus (2026-07-11)

**Decision.** Step 1.5 (the operator-gated live-bus cutover to R=3) is marked **[D] deferred** — it no
longer blocks the chain. Blocks 2-5 (circling, modes, management, savant) run on the **existing
single-node JetStream bus** on :4222; the cutover to the R=3 cluster happens when the operator wants
production resilience, run manually with the ground-truth runbook (kept from the 2026-07-10 audit).

**Why.** The cutover is a *resilience* upgrade, not a functional prerequisite — circling sessions,
the grappe registry (already live in GRAPPE_REGISTRY KV), management, and savant all work on the
single-node bus (it has JetStream). Blocking Block 2 — the premise test that decides whether the
whole architecture is worth building (2.6) — behind a production data migration is backwards: prove
the federation *works* first, harden to R=3 later. The 1.5 daemon prereqs are landed regardless
(mesh-task-daemon reconnect, ec4aad5; artifact-shape guard, this batch), so the cutover is ready when
wanted.

**Audit reconciliation (the collab races the parallel audit flagged for 2.1).** Assessed against the
real code: **#3** (malformed `circling_artifacts` → TypeError crash) is real → **fixed** (Array.isArray
guard). **#5** (TOCTOU double-advance of the circling step) is **NOT applicable** — the reflect
subscription is a single `for await (const msg of sub) { await handler(msg) }` loop, so same-subject
reflections are processed strictly serially; two reflect handlers never overlap (the daemon's own
"single-threaded, no mutex needed" comment is correct). **#4** (evaluateRound non-CAS lost-update) is
in the *sequential/parallel* collab path, which circling (2.1) does not use — deferred, not a 2.1
blocker. Net: 2.1 needs only the #3 guard, now in.

**Consequences.** 1.5 → [D]; the chain's next step becomes 2.1 (first live circling session). The 1.5
contract + runbook are preserved for the operator's eventual cutover. Plan-done (Block 5) does not
require the cutover; R=3 is an operator-timed hardening.

## D8 — First real adversarial task (2.4): harden the FEDERATION_SPEC schemas (operator-chosen 2026-07-11)

**Decision.** The first live qwen3:8b adversarial circling run (step 2.4) tackles a real, small,
reviewable task chosen by the operator: **harden the three FEDERATION_SPEC schema defects the
2026-07-10 parallel audit found.** This satisfies 2.4's Need ("a real small task chosen with the
operator") and dogfoods the federation on its own contract. The operator will review the artifacts
(2.4's `visual:` gate).

**Task brief (for the `mesh.collab.create` payload — circling / adversarial mode, 3 nodes):**
- **Title:** Harden FEDERATION_SPEC envelope + session schemas (audit F1/F2/F4).
- **Problem (fix exactly these three; do not rewrite the whole spec):**
  1. **F1** — envelopes (§5.1/5.2/5.3) timestamp with `issued_at`, but `verifyEvent` freshness keys on
     `timestamp` (`lib/node-identity.mjs`) → every envelope fails verification. Reconcile: use
     `timestamp` (or have the signer inject it); and correct the false claim that `signEvent` adds
     `event_id` (it adds only `signature`+`signer_pubkey`; the caller injects `event_id`).
  2. **F2** — no envelope carries a signer node id → the registry impersonation defense
     (`verifyEvent` `expectedNodeId`) can't run. Add `signer_node_id` and specify receivers pass it.
  3. **F4** — the spec invents `session.architecture` (§3) AND `session.type` (§4.1) as the mode
     discriminator; neither exists — the real discriminator is `session.mode` (`lib/mesh-collab.js`).
     Pick ONE real mechanism and make the spec consistent.
- **Inputs:** docs/FEDERATION_SPEC.md (§3, §5); lib/node-identity.mjs (signEvent/verifyEvent, the
  `timestamp` freshness gate); lib/mesh-collab.js (createSession, `session.mode`).
- **Acceptance:** for each of F1/F2/F4, a corrected schema/text block + a one-line rationale tied to
  the real interface (file:line). No changes outside these three defects.

**Why.** The spec is genuinely flawed (blocks Block 3-5 code) and the fixes are small + checkable
against the audit — an ideal first real run. It also feeds 2.6 (the premise benchmark): the same task
run solo-vs-grappe gives a clean quality comparison.

**Consequences.** 2.4's Need is met (task recorded here). The tick runs the qwen3:8b session and
BLOCKS at Phase 5 (visual:) for the operator to review the hardened-spec artifact before closing.
If the grappe's output is good, it also becomes the basis for actually correcting the spec (a
follow-on scope), closing the F1/F2/F4 OUT_OF_SCOPE items.

## D9 — Deployability overhaul: the install becomes self-verifying (operator-directed 2026-07-11)

**Decision.** Per the operator's in-session directive (spec sheet → parameters → corrected install
→ test protocol), the install path was overhauled as scope batch `deployability-install-overhaul`
(full evidence: `audits/deployability_overhaul/AUDIT.md`). The load-bearing choices:

1. **Single-node NATS is the default bus** — new `ai.openclaw.nats` unit (autostart, loopback,
   token, JetStream, absolute store_dir). The R=3 cluster stays the 1.5 operator-gated upgrade.
2. **Local-first brain is wired, not folkloric** — `MESH_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama`, RAM-tiered
   `LLM_MODEL` (check-llm-baseline), `LLM_BASE_URL` live in openclaw.env AND render into the
   agent units. install installs ollama, pulls the model, prefetches BGE-M3 (`--skip-llm` opts out).
3. **Workspace resolves the repo's ENTIRE dependency set** (symlink-all, 168 links) — fixed
   allow-lists rot: `zod` and `packages/event-schemas` were both missed by every static audit and
   caught only by the live boot test.
4. **Agents stay on-demand** (autostart:false); per-node agent units remain Block 6 work.
5. **Honest demotions** — gateway (exec target not vendored) and mesh-tool-discord (token
   required) go autostart:false instead of crash-looping.
6. **The install proves itself or fails** — render audit aborts on live `${VAR}` placeholders;
   `--update` never bare-unloads a running node; the final phase runs `node-acceptance.mjs`
   fail-loud when services were started. docs/NODE_SPEC.md is the deployment contract;
   docs/INSTALL_TEST_PROTOCOL.md the proof ladder.

**Why.** The 2026-07-11 fresh-install audit: a clean install produced a node where exactly two
subsystems worked (notifications, node-watch); memory-daemon was dead at import; no bus ever ran;
the deploy gate existed and was never invoked. The operator elevated out-of-box deployability to a
first-class requirement.

**Consequences.** 6.1 is reworded into the T7 deployability gate (clean-machine run of the test
protocol — still `[ ]`; sandbox verification is NOT the fresh-machine claim). 2.4/2.6 are
unaffected (they run on the dev box). Still open from the audit: MC production build (20 tsc
errors), consolidation LLM wiring, `--dry-run` honesty, full MULTI_NODE_DEPLOY rewrite, Linux T7.

## D10 — North star pinned: the unit of federation is an OpenClaw, not a model (operator, 2026-07-12)

**Decision.** The operator's governing statement, now pinned at the top of ROADMAP.md: the
project sequence is (1) local harness (memory + everything) optimized for an **agnostic
OpenClaw**, (2) **wire it to another OpenClaw — same setup, different machine**, (3) grappes/
clusters **of OpenClaws** on distinct working protocols, (4) a management cluster node for meta
managerial task cognition. **A grappe member is a full OpenClaw node** — the frontend-agnostic
agent plus its local harness, one per machine, joined by signed membership.

**The drift this corrects.** The 2026-07-06 plan authoring silently substituted the mind of a
worker: ROADMAP constraint 3 bound roles to `LLM_MODEL` (qwen via the ollama queue) and L0
defined nodes as spawn-node trees, so a dev convenience (3 logical nodes + raw-model
mesh-agents on one box) was promoted into the architecture, and multi-machine — the actual
point — was demoted to a deferral (7.1). The decision was never surfaced to the operator as a
decision; it traveled inside step contracts (2.4's "via qwen3:8b", D8's payload). **Process
rule going forward: architecture-defining choices must land in this ledger explicitly, never
be embedded in step contracts by plan authoring.**

**Reclassifications.**
- The current single-box rig (spawn-node trees, mesh-agents wrapping ollama) = **protocol
  scaffold**. Steps 2.1–2.4 evidence stands as scaffold-level proof of the circling
  choreography (barriers, retries, budgets, votes) — valid and valuable, but NOT proof of a
  production grappe.
- The local model (qwen tier) = the harness's infrastructure organ (extraction, embeddings,
  probes) and scaffold stand-in. Never the definition of a worker's mind.
- **Production worker integration becomes a first-class step** (Block 3 entry or 2.x addition —
  next planning pass with the operator): the grappe participant is the node's OpenClaw agent
  (e.g., Claude Code headless / companion lane / whatever frontend that node runs), driven
  through the same mesh-collab machinery the scaffold proved.
- **7.1 (multi-machine) is the spine, not a nice-to-have** — it stays [D] only until a second
  machine exists to join; the D9 deployability overhaul ("same setup, different machine"
  install) is its direct prerequisite, now understood as step (2) of the north star.
- 2.6's premise benchmark ultimately means "N OpenClaws circling vs 1 OpenClaw"; a
  scaffold-level 2.6 may still run first as a cheap pre-test of the protocol's value.

**Consequences.** ROADMAP carries the north star preamble; the next planning pass re-derives
Block 2 exit / Block 3 entry against the OpenClaw-as-worker contract; the 2.4 visual gate and
the thinking-stream fix (AUDIT_PRE §5 finding 6) proceed unchanged — the scaffold still has to
work to prove the choreography.

## D11 — Grappe/cluster workers MUST be a full local OpenClaw with an advanced LLM; qwen is never a node's mind (operator directive, 2026-07-13)

**Decision.** Absolute, enforced restatement of D10 per direct operator directive: **the grappe/
cluster project is NOT to be used for anything less than a local OpenClaw driven by an advanced
LLM.** A grappe member = a full OpenClaw node (the frontend-agnostic agent + its local harness),
one per machine, whose mind is an **advanced LLM** (Claude / GPT / Kimi / DeepSeek-class). The local
qwen model is the harness's **infrastructure organ ONLY** — memory extraction, embeddings, local
probes — and is **NEVER** a grappe worker, reviewer, or manager.

**Eradicated.** Every presentation of qwen3:8b (or any raw local model) as the node/worker LLM is
struck from the plan and docs. The single-box qwen mesh-agent scaffold (spawn-node trees +
`mesh-agent --model qwen3:8b`) is **retired as a worker.** Steps 2.1–2.4 stand ONLY as proofs of
the choreography **mechanism** (barriers, retries, budgets, votes, envelopes) — NOT proofs of worker
quality. No grappe/cluster capability may be exercised, benchmarked (2.6), deployed, or claimed on a
sub-OpenClaw worker.

**Runtime.** The running qwen mesh-agent scaffold was stopped 2026-07-13; the tick's in-flight 2.4
qwen worker run is void as a worker-quality proof.

**Consequences.** 2.4 is re-scoped — "first real adversarial run" means the node's real OpenClaw
agent on an advanced LLM, not qwen; its worker-quality gate folds into the OpenClaw-as-worker
integration step (D10). 2.6 = grappe-of-OpenClaws vs solo-OpenClaw. The `MESH_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama`
/ `LLM_MODEL=qwen3:8b` mesh-agent default wired in D9 is now a **defect** (a fresh node must not
default its grappe worker to a local model) — flagged for the next code pass. qwen survives in the
docs ONLY where it is the extraction/embedding/probe organ (NODE_SPEC local-model row; llm-client
extraction), explicitly labelled as such.

## D12 — Reconciling the ledger with the running box: the cutover happened, the probes lied, and the cluster template regresses D2/D4 (2026-07-16, after the deep review)

**Why this entry exists.** D10's process rule requires a DECISIONS entry before a decision's terms
are weakened or superseded. Three things happened on this box without one. This records them
retroactively and honestly rather than leaving the ledger contradicting the runtime.

**1. The R=3 cutover already happened — undocumented (Jul 14, 19:41 EDT).** A real 3-node
`openclaw-cluster` (nats-1/2/3, ports 4222/4223/4224) has been live since Jul 14 19:41 — configs
rendered 19:11, plists 19:31, processes up 19:41: a deliberate manual cutover. Step **1.5 is still
`[D]`**, no step close, no decision entry, and COMPONENT_REGISTRY still claimed "single node,
cluster=NONE, verified 2026-07-10" until today. The old single-node unit (`ai.openclaw.nats`) remains
loaded and dead (exit 1). **The registry is corrected in this commit; 1.5 stays `[D]`** — the row's
gate is the operator's, and machine-loss failover remains unproven (all three nodes are procs on ONE
box, which is not failsafe).

**2. The Jul-15 R=1→R=3 KV migration was a production mutation of the class 1.5 reserves.** The five
mesh buckets were migrated live with no before/after numbers recorded, no audit, no decision. It is
done and the buckets are R=3/3 peers; `GRAPPE_REGISTRY` was recreated **empty** in the process (the
wg-alpha manifest is gone — see also the probe side-effect below). Recorded here as the missing
provenance.

**3. `services/nats/nats-cluster-node.conf` regresses D2/D4 — ACKNOWLEDGED, NOT YET FIXED.** D2/D4
record, with evidence, "never all-interfaces; bind the Tailscale interface." The committed template
binds `0.0.0.0` on client/monitor/**cluster** and leaves the **cluster port unauthenticated**,
mitigated only by a comment. This was not a considered trade: NATS rejected the *token* form of
cluster auth and the author dropped auth instead of using the user/password form NATS does support.
**This entry does NOT supersede D2/D4 — it records a known violation.** Not currently exploitable
(the template is deployed nowhere; no second machine exists). **Binding constraint: the correct fix
— bind the node's own tailscale address + cluster user/password credentials (which requires route
credentials in `nats-cluster-config.js` + install) — MUST land before any second machine joins.**

**4. Probe honesty remediation (this commit).** The 6.4 "honesty fix" shipped a quorum probe that
could not detect quorum loss (`connect_urls` includes self; `1 + min(routes, connect_urls.length)`
counted self twice ⇒ both peers dead graded "quorum held 2/3, WORKING"). Now graded from
`jsz.meta_cluster` (raft leader ⇒ majority reachable), **verified by inducing a real outage**:
2 of 3 nodes unloaded → raft stepped down at ~24s → node-watch `BROKEN — quorum LOST`, acceptance
`GATE: REJECTED`; restored. Also fixed: the grappe heartbeat field mapping (`reportedAt`/`nodeId` —
the WORKING branch was unreachable against production data), and the "read-only" probe that CREATED
KV buckets (`bindOnly`) — the likely cause of the empty GRAPPE_REGISTRY in item 2.

**5. Step 6.3 is REOPENED to `[A]`.** It was closed `[x]` on inference: the contracted observation
("a killed grappe member flips a probe and fires a ledgered popup, observed") was replaced by a
hand-fired `openclaw-notify` popup plus the reasoning "a literal member-kill produces the same edge."
Additionally the live watcher had never loaded the probe code (it started Jul 14, ~23h before the
code existed) — so nothing it was closed on ran in the running system. The watcher is now restarted
and grading fed.* live; the literal member-kill is still owed and the grappe substrate is cold.

**Standing consequence.** A step whose Verify contract says *observed* does not close on inference.
Where an observation is impossible today, the step stays `[A]` with the reason — it does not close
with prose that reads like evidence.

### D12 §3 CLOSURE (2026-07-17, item 9)

The `nats-cluster-node.conf` D2/D4 violation recorded above is FIXED before any second machine
exists: the template now binds the machine's OWN tailnet address (install refuses 0.0.0.0 —
`--cluster-bind` required or tailscale-detected), the monitor is loopback-only, and the cluster
port is authenticated (user/password; routes carry credentials — the original auth was dropped when
the TOKEN form was rejected; the user/password form NATS supports is now used). Verified live on a
scratch 2-server cluster: correct credentials → authed cluster forms (jsz meta cluster_size 2);
wrong password → "authentication error – User openclaw-route … Router connection closed:
Authentication Failure" and the cluster is untouched. Evidence:
audits/item9_cluster_security/drill-output.txt. D2/D4 conformance restored.

## D13 — HyperAgent is an evidence-driven, human-gated strategy loop, not autonomous self-modification (2026-07-20)

**Decision.** HyperAgent may mechanically collect mesh task telemetry, select and inject an approved
strategy, create identity-scoped reflection windows, and maintain proposal observations. LLM synthesis
may propose strategy changes, but a human must approve every change. The only apply surface is
structured strategy data; no harness, workflow, source-code, or filesystem mutation may be presented
as HyperAgent behavior without a separate explicit design and gate.

**Identity boundary.** Strategies with `node_id=NULL` are shared fallbacks. Node-owned strategies are
visible only to that node and take precedence over shared fallbacks. Updating a shared fallback from a
node reflection creates a node-local override; it does not deactivate the shared strategy fleet-wide.

**Evidence language.** The existing window is observational: the proposal is not applied, assignment
is not randomized, and the output is not causal. Product/docs/UI must not call it A/B testing. A future
causal trial requires an explicit treatment application and experimental contract.

**Runtime truth.** The 2026-07-20 remediation made the mesh producer, strategy application,
attribution, scheduler, deployment probe, and watcher mechanical. Local companion logging and LLM
synthesis remain prompt-assisted. At verification time the live database held one telemetry row and no
strategies/reflections/proposals, so no learning or improvement claim is yet permitted. Full evidence:
`audits/hyperagent_deep_review/DEEP_REVIEW_2026-07-20.md`.

## D14 — Reopen the written premise contract; keep the qualified hand-run as history (2026-08-02)

**Decision.** Step 2.6 is reopened from `[x]` to `[A]`, and `VERSION` becomes `v2.6-pre` so the
next execution resumes from the already-written five-task design. The July 15 hand-run remains
valid as a transparent, operator-approved **qualified result**: one blinded comparable pair was
scored and the grappe won. It is not discarded or recast as misconduct. It is insufficient to
satisfy the inventory's predeclared `>=5` task contract and therefore cannot carry the Phase-1
premise gate by itself.

**Why.** The automated run wedged, produced asymmetric artifacts, and was abandoned; the close
then relied on one tool-free hand comparison after the operator reduced the immediate run. The
audit disclosed all of that honestly, but the inventory contract was never amended before close.
Governance cannot treat an acknowledged scope reduction as evidence that the original threshold
was met. The plan now needs five comparable tasks using the same advanced LLM and equivalent tool
access, blind scoring, and explicit token/wall-clock cost.

**Consequences.** Step 3.5 remains `[A]` but is blocked on the reopened 2.6 result. Steps 6.2 and
6.3 remain `[A]` for their own outstanding visual and literal-kill gates. Management step 4.1 is
not the next action. After runtime repair restores real advanced-LLM workers, the order is 2.6
evidence, then the 3.5 matrix/chaos/soak/T7 gate, then Block 4. No threshold tuning or retrospective
task substitution is permitted during the rerun.

## D15 — The premise benchmark FAILED on reliability and WON on quality-when-delivered; the plan is blocked and the redesign door is explicit (2026-08-05, operator "go")

**Decision.** Step 2.6 closes with **PREMISE NOT EVIDENCED**. Per D3 this is a plan-level BLOCK
(`BLOCKED.md`): step 3.5 and Blocks 4-5 may not proceed. The plan does not close and the worker
grappe code is not deleted; it unblocks only by operator plan-closure or by a redesigned
convergence protocol passing a NEW preregistered benchmark.

**The evidence.** Two runs under operator-predeclared RUN_RULES, each from a frozen SHA:
- **Run 1 (2026-08-04) — INCONCLUSIVE, preserved.** An operator audit found the temporary
  orchestrator was neither committed nor tested and mis-implemented clause 2 (counting
  consecutive 45 s polls instead of a ≥90 s window), invalidating one forfeit; two host
  suspensions contaminated three more pairs. The verdict claimed from it was RETRACTED.
- **Apparatus repair (not tuning).** The driver became `bin/fed-run-driver.mjs` with unit tests
  encoding both defects as regressions (≥90 s gate window; >5 min inter-poll gap ⇒
  INFRA_INVALID, rerun-eligible, never a forfeit). Treatment files were byte-identical
  throughout — verified by the operator's audit.
- **Run 2 (2026-08-05) — CLEAN.** Zero suspensions. Pairs 1-3: grappe gate-forfeits, each
  measured across a full 90 s window. Pairs 4-5: delivered and collected.
- **Scoring-package repair.** A further operator audit found the package leaked its own key
  (in-dir meta exposed the arm mapping via char counts) and that the blinding redacted the very
  domain vocabulary Task 5 is about. Both pairs were repackaged from the immutable raw KV
  artifacts (fresh flips, sha256, key/meta sealed outside the scorer path) with
  content-preserving blinding; scoring used the full five-dimension rubric by two fresh
  zero-context judges. One of them independently rediscovered the operator's own finding — both
  Task-5 candidates misattribute the `MESH_NODE_HEALTH` heartbeat to the killed agent
  (`mesh-health-publisher` writes it) — confirming both the finding and the judges' independence.
- **Final: solo 3 · grappe 2 · tie 0** (bar: ≥4). Cost **$20.07 vs $1.81 (~11×)**.

**What was actually falsified.** Reliability: 3 of 5 pairs produced no grappe artifact at all,
each time because its own finalization vote failed to converge — the chronic pattern across
every smoke. What was NOT falsified: quality. The grappe won BOTH blind comparisons it reached
(21-18, 20-15), with judges verifying citations against source. The broken component is the
**unanimity-gated finalization protocol**, not the collaboration concept.

## D16 — Consensus gating is DEAD; federation is a deterministic pipeline (OPERATOR RULING, 2026-08-05)

**Decision.** Operator ruling, verbatim intent: *"the eventual federation will work by itself as
an automated prompt-response-ingestion-response system — not a 'do you think it's good.'"* All
agreement machinery is removed from the federation design going forward: no votes, no sign-offs,
no convergence bars, no unanimity, no subjective quality gates anywhere inside the flow. A
federation work unit is a FIXED-PASS deterministic pipeline — draft → reviews ingested as input →
revision — and the result **ships unconditionally** at the end of the last pass. No participant
can hold an output hostage. Quality is judged downstream by use and by evidence programs (blind
scoring, telemetry), never by polling the participants.

**Why.** The D15 evidence decomposes exactly along this line: both blind quality wins were
produced by the pipeline segment (draft → review-artifacts → revision); every reliability
failure — 3 of 5 run-2 pairs, and the chronic gate across all three smokes and run 1 — was the
opinion gate at the end. The circling ceremony (votes, sub-round barriers, reviewer sign-offs,
finalization unanimity) was agent-grown elaboration approved in bulk inside larger plans, not an
operator requirement; the operator has now explicitly rejected it, and the benchmark had already
falsified it independently.

**Consequences.** (1) `circling_strategy`'s vote/finalization machinery is retired from the
forward design — existing code and tests remain as history; nothing new builds on them. (2) The
D15 redesign door is now DEFINED: pipeline mode (fixed passes, unconditional ship). (3) Per D15,
the block stands until pipeline mode passes a NEW preregistered five-task benchmark under the
existing committed apparatus (fed-run-driver + RUN_RULES pattern; forfeit rules simplify — the
gate-forfeit clause becomes vestigial since no gate exists; budget and infra clauses carry over).
(4) Blocks 4 (management) and 5 (savant), when/if reached, inherit the same law: deterministic
dataflow, no consensus gating — the 3/5-quorum management design must be re-derived under D16
before any of it is built. (5) The mesh solo lane is untouched — benchmark-proven reliable
(8/8 completions across smokes and runs).

**Consequences.** D14's rerun mandate is discharged. The July hand-run's "qualified pass" is
superseded by a properly powered negative result. Any future iteration must preregister anew —
no reuse of this run's artifacts as evidence for a redesigned protocol, and no retroactive
loosening of D3's bar. The benchmark apparatus (fed-benchmark + fed-run-driver + rules + tests)
is now reusable infrastructure and stays.
