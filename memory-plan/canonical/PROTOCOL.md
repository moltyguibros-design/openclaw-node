# PROTOCOL — The Plan-Silo Operating Base

**Canonical doc.** Authored in `memory-plan/canonical/`, recopied into every plan by
`workspace-bin/sync-canonical.sh`. Applies to all plans equally.

**What this is.** The complete, plan-agnostic contract for how a plan runs in this repo: what a
silo contains, how a step executes (the 9 phases), how the viewer renders it, how the autonomous
tick chain drives it, and how a new plan iteration is instantiated. It is the **silo-resolved
binding** of `FRAMEWORK_CANONICAL.md` (the portable theory doc): the silo restructure standardized
every per-plan path, so the framework's placeholder table collapses into the conventions below.

**Precedence.** `MASTER_PLAN.md` (principles, done-contract) governs this doc. This doc governs
every plan created after 2026-06-03. The `legacy/` and `redesign/` silos keep their own
`FRAMEWORK.md` / `WORKFLOW.md` copies as the historical record of how those plans ran; where they
differ from this doc, they are history, not authority.

---

## 1. Silo anatomy — the standard manifest

A **plan** is any immediate subdirectory of `memory-plan/plans/` containing `INVENTORY.md` +
`VERSION` (the viewer's discovery rule). A full silo carries three tiers of files:

### 1.1 Synced — the rules (identical in every silo; never edit a plan's copy)

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `MASTER_PLAN.md` | North star + non-negotiable principles + the §5 done-contract |
| `PROTOCOL.md` | This doc — the operating base |
| `FRAMEWORK_CANONICAL.md` | The portable 9-phase framework (theory + rationale) |
| `COWORK_MODEL.md` | What this system is: a local cowork-style chained agent pipeline |
| `BLOCK_TEMPLATE.md` | The shape a `BLOCKED.md` must take |

Authored in `memory-plan/canonical/`; `sync-canonical.sh` propagates. Editing a silo's copy is
drift — the next sync erases it. Change the canonical source instead.

### 1.2 Instantiated — the working state (scaffolded once by `new-plan.sh`, then plan-owned)

| File | Role | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| `INVENTORY.md` | The step list: blocks × atomic steps, status `[ ]` open · `[A]` in-flight · `[x]` closed · `[D]` deferred (deliberate; never a next step, never blocks completion, no §11 contract required), per-step done-evidence | **yes** (discovery) |
| `VERSION` | Single-line carrier `vX.Y[-pre|-mid]` | **yes** (discovery) |
| `OUT_OF_SCOPE.md` | Drift capture | yes |
| `DECISIONS.md` | Append-only architectural ledger | yes |
| `ROADMAP.md` | The plan's phases/blocks and why — what INVENTORY decomposes | yes |
| `COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md` | Current runtime state of what the plan touches | recommended |
| `TICK_PROMPT.md` | The prompt piped into headless `claude` per tick | tick-only |
| `automation.json` | Tick scheduling config (plist label, interval, command) | tick-only |

### 1.3 Generated — produced by running the plan (never scaffolded with content)

`audits/stepNN_<slug>/AUDIT_PRE.md` + `AUDIT_POST.md` (per step) · `tick-logs/` (per tick:
`<ts>.log` pretty, `<ts>.jsonl` raw, `current.log` symlink) · `BLOCKED.md` (only while blocked;
operator deletes to resume).

There is **no `VERSION_LOG.md`** in the standard silo: one commit per step on `main` makes
`git log` the append-only step ledger (protocol plan DECISIONS D2).

## 2. The five layers (top governs bottom)

```
GOVERNANCE   MASTER_PLAN + PROTOCOL (+ plan-local taste docs, e.g. DESIGN_INPUTS)
  ROADMAP      <plan>/ROADMAP.md — the blocks and why
    STEP LIST    <plan>/INVENTORY.md — atomic steps; one step = one 9-phase = one commit
      EXECUTION    the 9 phases
        TRUTH        COMPONENT_REGISTRY + DECISIONS + audits/ + the viewer (:7892)
```

The chain from intent to shipped, every arrow auditable:

```
ROADMAP block → INVENTORY step → 9-phase execution
  → VERIFY incl. runtime evidence → REGISTRY/DECISIONS updated → one commit → viewer shows it
```

A step with no roadmap basis shouldn't exist; a commit with no closed step means the protocol
was bypassed.

## 3. The per-step lifecycle (the 9 phases, silo-resolved)

| Phase | Action |
|---|---|
| Pre-flight | Pick the first `[ ]`/`[A]` row. Tree clean (or dirty matching an in-flight `-pre`/`-mid`). `BLOCKED.md` present → stop. Read MASTER_PLAN + the step's ROADMAP block + prior step's AUDIT_POST §6. |
| 1 · §0 | **Micro Re-Orient** — ≤6 lines, first thing in AUDIT_PRE (§5.1 below). |
| 1 | `AUDIT_PRE.md` in `audits/stepNN_<slug>/`: intent, design (consume prior carry-forwards), risk register, §6 file-delta outline. **Pre-screen: verify every Need in the step's §11 contract exists; missing → BLOCK.** Write `vX.Y-pre` to `VERSION`. Flip the row `[ ]`→`[A]`. No production work yet. |
| 4 | Implement every §6 delta — nothing else. Surprises append to AUDIT_PRE `## Mid-Implementation Findings` and/or `OUT_OF_SCOPE.md`, never silent expansion. Then write `vX.Y-mid` to `VERSION`. |
| 5 | **Verify** = (a) tests green at baseline (`npm test` here), AND (b) the step's **Verify contract** (§11) executed exactly as written — `runtime:` probe / `code:` check / `visual:` operator confirmation (headless → BLOCK naming it). Cannot observe → BLOCK, never fake-close. |
| 7 | `AUDIT_POST.md`: §1 promised-vs-landed ledger (every row `yes` or the step isn't done), §2 greppable deltas (command + first hit), §3 cross-refs still valid, §4 findings `[POSITIVE]/[NEGATIVE]`, §5 Phase-8 patches (almost always none), §6 carry-forwards to the next step. |
| 8 | Apply §5 patches. An architectural choice not pre-decided in DECISIONS/carry-forwards → BLOCK + propose a DECISIONS entry. |
| 8.5 | **Deep Review Gate** — all six or BLOCK: ① VERSION is exactly `vX.Y-mid` ② every §6 delta greppable ③ staged diff = §6 deltas + ledger files, nothing more ④ tests green ⑤ INVENTORY/audit docs consistent ⑥ **runtime evidence captured and real**. |
| 9 | One commit (format §3.1). Flip the row `[A]`→`[x]` with a one-line close note. `VERSION` → clean `vX.Y`. Update COMPONENT_REGISTRY. **Record the Feeds landing (§11): where the output lives, which consumer reaches it.** Log any DECISIONS. **STOP — one step per work unit.** |
| Block close | If this step closed a block: **Macro Re-Orient** (§5.2) before the next block's first step. |

### 3.1 Commit format

```
vX.Y — <step description verbatim from INVENTORY.md>

Phase 4: <one-sentence delta>.
Runtime-Evidence: <the observed proof — command + result>.
V2 audit: <N> POSITIVE, <M> Phase 8 patches.
```

The `Runtime-Evidence:` trailer is mandatory (MASTER_PLAN §5). No observable evidence → no
commit → BLOCK. Ticks add `Authored-By: <plan>-tick`; no amends, no force-push, no remote push.

## 4. Version carriers

`VERSION` holds exactly one of: `vX.Y` (step X.Y closed — next tick starts the following step at
Phase 1) · `vX.Y-pre` (Phase 1 done — resume at Phase 4) · `vX.Y-mid` (Phases 1+4+5 done — resume
at Phase 7). Initial state `v0.0`. The suffix is the cold-pickup resume pointer: any worker
(human, tick, new session) reads VERSION + INVENTORY and knows exactly where the plan stands.

## 5. The Re-Orient Loop

Structure against attention drift: the deeper the dig, the more often you surface.

### 5.1 Micro — every step (the floor)

First block of every AUDIT_PRE, ≤6 lines: where am I (block/step/overall) · what the last step
changed · what THIS step contributes to the block · which north-star line the block serves ·
"still the right next step?" (no → BLOCK + re-plan). Can't fill it in → you don't know where you
are; stop and re-read the plan.

### 5.2 Macro — every block close (the ceiling)

Before the next block's first step: re-read MASTER_PLAN principles (+ plan taste docs) · update
COMPONENT_REGISTRY with **runtime probes** (ps/curl/sql/log), not memory · re-survey the remaining
INVENTORY (atomicity, order — split/re-order if the block taught better) · drift check (anything
landed outside a step? OUT_OF_SCOPE items worth promoting?) · log course-corrections in DECISIONS.

### 5.3 The tripwire

If Phase 4 sprawls into many sub-actions or ≥2 mid-implementation findings, the step was not
atomic. Stop, re-orient, split the step, re-plan. Don't push through a step that quietly became
three.

## 6. The viewer contract (workplan-viewer :7892)

`workspace-bin/workplan-viewer.mjs`, default port 7892 (`WORKPLAN_VIEWER_PORT`), roots at
`memory-plan/plans` (`WORKPLAN_ROOTS`, colon-separated). **Discovery:** immediate subdirs of a
root containing `INVENTORY.md` + `VERSION`; rescan every 60s. **Fully siloed:** every tab resolves
from the plan's own dir; the viewer never reaches outside `<root>/<id>/`.

| Tab | Reads | Shows |
|---|---|---|
| Master Plan | `COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md` · `DECISIONS.md` · `OUT_OF_SCOPE.md` | The governance dashboard: runtime truth, choices, deferred drift |
| Steps | `INVENTORY.md` · `audits/*/AUDIT_{PRE,POST}.md` | The checklist: per-step status + audit links |
| Live | SSE tail of `tick-logs/current.log` | The current tick's pretty output, live |
| Progress | SSE of `tick-logs/<ts>.jsonl` | The current tick's structured activity (tool calls, messages) |
| Automation | `automation.json` + launchd state | Load/unload/kickstart/run-once + params |
| Block | `BLOCKED.md` (when present) | What stopped the chain + the **External action** needed |
| Documents | every `*.md` in the plan dir | Raw doc browser |
| History | `tick-logs/*.log` · audits | Past ticks and closes |

Missing docs degrade gracefully (`present:false` → "No X found in this plan") — a minimal silo
(INVENTORY + VERSION) renders without errors. Live/Progress are fed **only by tick runs**;
interactive sessions don't write tick-logs, so empty ≠ broken.

**The viewer is the re-orient surface** (§5): micro = glance at Master Plan tab + inventory
progress before digging; macro = study it before opening a block.

## 7. The tick-chain contract (autonomous mode)

One generic engine drives any plan: `workspace-bin/plan-tick.sh <plan-id>`. Because the viewer
and launchd invoke the tick command with **no argv**, each plan fronts the engine with a generated
two-line shim `workspace-bin/<id>-tick.sh` (`exec plan-tick.sh <id>`), which is what
`automation.json.tick_command` points at. One tick = exactly one step (or a BLOCK):

```
launchd (ai.openclaw.<id>-tick, interval from automation.json) fires <id>-tick.sh
  └─ guards: BLOCKED.md present → exit · dirty tree on clean VERSION → write stall-BLOCKED + exit
            · single-tick lock (stale-reaped >60min) · no [ ]/[A] rows → plan complete, exit
  └─ invoke: cat <plan>/TICK_PROMPT.md | claude --print --permission-mode acceptEdits
  └─ record: tick-logs/<ts>.{log,jsonl} + current.log symlink + one digest line
  └─ outcome: VERSION advanced → step closed · BLOCKED.md written → exit 2, operator clears
```

`--preflight` reports the next step and guard state without invoking claude. **Blocking is
success; fake-closing is the cardinal failure** — the TICK_PROMPT's runtime-evidence gate is what
makes autonomous ticks safe to leave running. A new plan's tick plist starts **unloaded**:
enabling the chain is an explicit operator decision per plan (viewer Automation tab or
`launchctl`).

## 8. Write-time enforcement (removed 2026-09-14)

A PreToolUse hook (`.claude/hooks/scope-check.sh`) used to refuse any edit whose target was not
listed in an active, unexpired `<plan>/SCOPE.md`. It and the `SCOPE.md` files were removed at the
operator's instruction — the `Expires` field latched the repo shut three times and the mechanism
never caught a real mistake. Nothing gates writes now; §3's phase discipline is convention.

## 9. Starting a new plan iteration

```
workspace-bin/new-plan.sh <id> ["one-line goal"]
```

Scaffolds `memory-plan/plans/<id>/` from `canonical/templates/` (tier-1.2 files with `{{PLAN_ID}}`
/`{{GOAL}}`/`{{DATE}}` bound), creates `audits/` + `tick-logs/`, sets `VERSION` to `v0.0`, writes
the `<id>-tick.sh` shim, and runs `sync-canonical.sh` (tier-1.1 docs land). The result is
viewer-discoverable immediately and tick-runnable once you fill in the plan.

Then, before the first step runs (the part no scaffolder can do):

1. **ROADMAP.md** — write the blocks: what phases, in what order, why; each block's exit criterion.
2. **INVENTORY.md** — decompose to atomic grain. Apply the atomicity test to every step: exactly
   one independently-verifiable runtime outcome; needs "and" → split. Every step gets
   **done-evidence** that is runtime-observable, written next to the table.
3. **TICK_PROMPT.md** — fill the `{{...}}` bindings (test command, runtime deploy target, plan
   specifics in required reading).
4. **COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md** — record the verified current state of what the plan will touch
   (reality first: probe, don't assume).
5. **DECISIONS.md** — log D1: why this plan exists and the approach chosen.
6. Agree the first step with the operator, then either work it interactively or load the tick
   plist (Automation tab) to hand it to the chain.

Retiring a plan: note the closure in DECISIONS, leave the silo in place — it is the
complete, portable record of the run (the cowork-bundle property, COWORK_MODEL §2).

## 10. Surface conformance — what "functionally implements" means

Every plan must functionally wire all six file-backed viewer surfaces — populated and parseable,
not merely "missing docs degrade gracefully". The functional bar per surface:

| Surface (tab) | Files | Functional bar |
|---|---|---|
| **master-plan** | `COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md` · `DECISIONS.md` · `OUT_OF_SCOPE.md` | REGISTRY has ≥1 probed, dated row; DECISIONS has ≥ D1; the tab alone answers: what runs, what was chosen, what's deferred. |
| **steps** | `INVENTORY.md` · `audits/stepNN_<slug>/` | Rows in the load-bearing 5-column format; every **open** row carries the §11 contract; every `[A]` step has `AUDIT_PRE.md`, every `[x]` step has `AUDIT_PRE.md`+`AUDIT_POST.md`. |
| **automation** | `automation.json` · `TICK_PROMPT.md` · the `<id>-tick.sh` shim | Valid JSON with the standard keys; `tick_command` exists and is executable; TICK_PROMPT present — and `<FILL` bindings resolved before the chain is enabled. |
| **block** | `BLOCKED.md` (conditional) | Absent (chain runnable), or matching the BLOCK_TEMPLATE shape with **External action:** naming the operator's single concrete move. |
| **documents** | the five synced canonical docs · `ROADMAP.md` | Canonical copies byte-identical with `canonical/` (sync `--check` clean for this silo); ROADMAP present with every block carrying intent + exit criterion. |
| **history** | `tick-logs/` · `VERSION` | Dir exists (ticks write `<ts>.log`/`.jsonl` + `current.log`); VERSION coheres with INVENTORY — `v0.0`, or `vX.Y[-pre|-mid]` pointing at a real row. |

Conformance is **machine-graded** by `workspace-bin/plan-lint.sh <id>`: PASS / WARN / FAIL per
surface, exit 0 only with zero FAILs. Closed (`[x]`) rows predating the §11 contract grade WARN
(grandfathered); open rows without contracts FAIL. The lint runs at scaffold end (new-plan.sh)
and in every tick preflight, so non-conformance is visible at both birth and run time.

## 11. The step contract — extreme atomization

Every **open** INVENTORY row carries a four-field contract in the notes under its table:

```
> **X.Y — Goal:** one sentence, one outcome.
> **Needs:** pre-screen — everything that must already exist (files, services, data, locked decisions).
> **Feeds:** post-use — where this result is consumed (later step / component / viewer surface / operator workflow).
> **Verify:** the enforceable test, tagged by modality — runtime: / code: / visual: — with its WIN threshold.
```

How each field is enforced across the phases (§3):

- **Goal** — the atomicity probe. Needs an "and" between two independently-testable outcomes →
  split the step before opening it.
- **Needs** — verified in **Phase 1** before any design: each Need is checked to exist (file
  present, service up, decision logged). A missing Need → BLOCK naming it; never "build it on
  the way" (that's a hidden second step).
- **Feeds** — checked at **Phase 9**: AUDIT_POST records where the output landed and which
  consumer can now reach it. An output nothing consumes is dead work — if Feeds can't be named
  at planning time, the step doesn't enter the inventory.
- **Verify** — executed in **Phase 5** exactly as written. `runtime:` = probe/command + observed
  threshold; `code:` = test/grep; `visual:` = operator-confirmable UI state — a headless tick
  must BLOCK on visual-only verification, citing it as the **External action:**. The Verify line
  is the step's done-contract instance (MASTER_PLAN §5): unobservable → unclosable.

Atomicity tightened: if **Goal** needs "and" → split. If **Needs** spans two unrelated systems →
split. If **Verify** proves two independent outcomes → split. (Two modalities proving ONE
outcome is fine.) Lineage: redesign's `LOOPS.md` flow framing — connects-with · purpose ·
produces-for · WIN/FAIL — generalized here for every plan.
