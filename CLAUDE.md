# openclaw-nodedev — Agent Bootstrap

**Plans are siloed, and the protocol base is shared.** The shared sources live in
[`memory-plan/canonical/`](memory-plan/canonical/): five synced docs (`MASTER_PLAN.md`,
`PROTOCOL.md`, `FRAMEWORK_CANONICAL.md`, `COWORK_MODEL.md`, `BLOCK_TEMPLATE.md`) copied into
every plan silo by `workspace-bin/sync-canonical.sh`, plus [`templates/`](memory-plan/canonical/templates/),
which `workspace-bin/new-plan.sh <id> ["goal"]` instantiates into a new viewer-valid silo.
`workspace-bin/plan-tick.sh <id>` is the one generic chain engine; per-plan `<id>-tick.sh` shims
front it (the viewer/launchd invoke tick commands argv-less). Every plan doc lives inside a
self-contained plan dir under `memory-plan/plans/<id>/`:
- [`memory-plan/plans/redesign/`](memory-plan/plans/redesign/) — local-first memory redesign. **COMPLETE at v6.5** (Blocks 0–6 delivered; Block 7 federation DEFERRED per its DECISIONS D4).
- [`memory-plan/plans/repair/`](memory-plan/plans/repair/) — chain repair. **COMPLETE at v7.8** (49/49 steps, all active blocks closed). Suite as of 2026-09-06: 1920 root / 118 Mission Control, green in CI.
- [`memory-plan/plans/protocol/`](memory-plan/plans/protocol/) — the meta-plan: the workplan operating base itself (canonical docs, generic engine, scaffolder).
- [`memory-plan/plans/federation/`](memory-plan/plans/federation/) — worker/management/savant grappes. **EVIDENCE FRONTIER at v2.6-pre**; management has not started.
- [`memory-plan/plans/hyperagent-evidence/`](memory-plan/plans/hyperagent-evidence/) — human-gated strategy evidence loop. **SUBSTRATE LIVE, COHORT NOT STARTED at v2.0**.
- [`memory-plan/plans/legacy/`](memory-plan/plans/legacy/) — the **completed** 58-step framework plan (archive / reference).

**Read these BEFORE any tool use, in this order:**

1. [`memory-plan/canonical/MASTER_PLAN.md`](memory-plan/canonical/MASTER_PLAN.md) — north star architecture + non-negotiable working principles + done-contract. The shared doc that governs everything you do in this repo (a synced copy sits in every plan silo).
2. [`memory-plan/canonical/PROTOCOL.md`](memory-plan/canonical/PROTOCOL.md) — **the plan-silo operating base**: silo anatomy, the per-step 9-phase lifecycle, version carriers, the Re-Orient Loop, the viewer + tick-chain contracts, and how a new plan iteration is instantiated.

Then the per-plan documents of the silo you are working in — every silo carries the same standard manifest (PROTOCOL §1):

3. `plans/<id>/ROADMAP.md` (redesign's is `MEMORY_REDESIGN.md`) — the plan's blocks and why.
4. [`plans/<id>/COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md`](memory-plan/plans/redesign/COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md) — current runtime state of what the plan touches. Reality, not aspiration.
5. [`plans/<id>/DECISIONS.md`](memory-plan/plans/redesign/DECISIONS.md) — append-only ledger of every architectural decision. The fastest way to absorb what was decided and why.
6. [`plans/<id>/INVENTORY.md`](memory-plan/plans/redesign/INVENTORY.md) — the atomic step list. The first `[ ]` row is the plan's next action. (Pre-protocol plans also carry their historical `WORKFLOW.md`/`FRAMEWORK.md` — for them, those govern; PROTOCOL.md governs plans created after 2026-06-03.)

The current ground-truth reconciliation is protocol step 3.1 under
[`memory-plan/plans/protocol/audits/step31_governance_recovery/`](memory-plan/plans/protocol/audits/step31_governance_recovery/).
Audits decay (MASTER_PLAN §4.9) — re-verify specific claims older than 14 days before acting on them.
`git log --oneline -20` shows the recent committed work.

## Where we are / next action

**As of 2026-09-06 (remediation, PR #6):** a repo-wide adversarial + lifecycle review
(`ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW_2026-09-06.md`) and its plan (`REMEDIATION_PLAN_2026-09-06.md`) landed with
Phases 0–3 implemented: secrets file perms, the foreign `npx openclaw-mesh` step removed, the three
RCE sinks closed, signed operator actions + ownership checks on the mesh bus, Mission Control
requiring its session token on every `/api` method, and the governance gates made mechanical (git
hooks via `npm prepare`, force-push refused, the tick refuses a close without a Runtime-Evidence
trailer or with a red suite, scope-check hardened). CI has been green since that PR; before it,
Tests had failed on `main` on every run from #158 (2026-08-02) to #165. Federation: DECISIONS D16
(2026-08-05) ruled consensus gating dead — federation is a deterministic pipeline; the D15 "unblocks
only by …" sentence below is superseded by D16. Runtime evidence for the remediation (deploy to
`~/.openclaw`, restart, observe) is still the operator's step.

As of 2026-08-05, the protocol base is live; redesign is complete at v6.5 and repair at v7.8.
**Federation is BLOCKED at v2.6** (`plans/federation/BLOCKED.md`, D15): the five-task premise
benchmark closed FAILED — run 2 tally solo 3 · grappe 2 · tie 0, below D3's ≥4-of-5 bar. The
grappe failed on RELIABILITY (3 of 5 pairs never delivered — its own finalization vote never
converged) but won BOTH blind five-dimension comparisons it reached (21-18, 20-15) at ~11× cost
($20.07 vs $1.81). Step 3.5, Block 4 (management) and Block 5 (savant) are blocked; 6.2/6.3
remain independently in-flight. Unblocks only by operator plan-closure or a redesigned
convergence protocol passing a NEW preregistered benchmark. Evidence:
`plans/federation/audits/step26_premise-benchmark/` + `benchmark/`.

HyperAgent's mechanical substrate and read-only MC page are live, but the production store has
1 telemetry row and no strategies, reflections, or proposals. The next step is operator-gated 2.1
preregistration. Companion I1-I5 is design-only and not required to preregister the mesh-primary stratum.

Fresh runtime probes: R=3 NATS quorum, memory daemon, Mission Control, mesh-task-daemon, mesh bridge,
node-watch, and workplan viewer are live. `mesh-agent`, gateway, and companion bridge were down at the
probe. Federation watch = 2 WORKING / 1 OFF / 1 UNKNOWN. This is substrate, not worker-cluster proof.

Queued runtime repair is specific (reconciled 2026-09-21):
the scheduler's false-busy idle gate, the scheduler/local-event NATS auth failure, and the dotted
local stream names were all CLOSED at protocol v4.1 (2026-08-02) — do not re-open them. Still open:
the first queue-authorized consolidation cycle exceeded the 300000 ms hard cap, so daily digest /
vault cadence is not proven restored (profile the expensive stage; do not merely raise the cap);
the scheduler heartbeat exit 22 / HTTP 401; the nested `lib/mcp-knowledge` tree loads Sharp 0.34.5
beside root Sharp 0.35.3 and has unresolved audit findings; watcher freshness/running-state gaps.
Do not claim the August daily note proved consolidation.

**2026-09-21 — plan `openviking-adopt` (PR pending):** after a review of `volcengine/OpenViking`,
four of its ideas landed natively (D1 there: ideas, not code — its core is AGPL-3.0): `path_prefix`
on knowledge search; per-directory L0 abstract / L1 overview summaries (`directory_summaries`,
knowledge schema v2, tools `knowledge_tree` / `directory_overview` / `search_directories`); typed
memory merge with read-before-write extraction (`lib/memory-types.mjs`, extraction-store schema v6:
`entity_aliases`, `decisions.superseded_by`, the extractor is shown KNOWN MEMORIES and answers with
`ref` / `aliases` / `supersedes`); and an OpenClaw context-engine plugin
(`packages/openclaw-memory-context-engine`) that injects the :7893 block in-process instead of via
companion-bridge. Code + container tests only: every INVENTORY row there stays `[ ]` until its
`runtime:` Verify is observed on the node (its D2).

**Next work after v3.1:** the bounded runtime-repair batch described above. Federation execution
stays locked until that repair lands.

**As of 2026-09-21 (foreman plan, step 1.1):** on operator instruction ("integrate the Foreman
tech"), a new silo [`memory-plan/plans/foreman/`](memory-plan/plans/foreman/) landed
`lib/foreman/` — the supervisory design of thruwire/foreman (fast local assessor answering ten
fixed questions → deterministic policy → small action vocabulary) wired into `bin/mesh-agent.js`
`runLLM`/`executeTask`, **enforcing by default** (Block 2 closed the same day, D2): a stuck or
off-track worker is stopped (process group) and retried with the reason in its prompt, an escalated
task is released for human triage, and a no-metric task completes only on an independent verifier's
`FOREMAN_VERDICT: PASS`. Every task gets a per-task timeline (`~/.openclaw/foreman/<task_id>.jsonl`)
and `mesh.foreman.*` events; `MESH_FOREMAN_ENFORCE=0` is shadow mode. An unavailable assessor is a
passthrough, never an escalation (D1). Runtime evidence on the operator's node is step 1.2. See
`docs/foreman.md`.

## Why this exists

In May 2026, 5 review rounds + 22 commits in 24h produced ~0 production change because:
- Work happened outside the previous framework's step boundaries
- "Done" was treated as "committed" with no runtime verification
- Two parallel daemons got built next to each other
- Code-on-disk and runtime drifted 4+ days apart

The plan structure — blocks, atomic steps, runtime evidence on every close — is the response.
There is no write gate: the scope contract (`.claude/hooks/scope-check.sh`, per-plan `SCOPE.md` and
`OUT_OF_SCOPE.md`, their `Expires` dates) was removed on 2026-09-23 at the operator's instruction
(protocol DECISIONS D10). Don't reintroduce it unless the operator asks. Commits and pushes are
still validated (`.claude/hooks/validate-{commit,push}.sh`, also wired as git hooks).

## Pointers

- **OS / shell:** macOS, zsh
- **Primary runtime:** `~/.openclaw/workspace/` (separate from this repo — see MASTER_PLAN §4.1 about the deploy gap)
- **Operator email:** guillaumebrossard04@gmail.com
- **Date format:** Montreal time (UTC-5/UTC-4 DST), full date + time when timestamping

## When you write code

- Default to writing no comments. WHY when non-obvious, never WHAT (MASTER_PLAN §4.8).
- Don't add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that can't happen. Trust internal code.
- Don't introduce backwards-compatibility shims when you can just change the code.
- No half-finished implementations. Either finish per MASTER_PLAN §5 done-contract, or track the remainder in the plan's INVENTORY.md (MASTER_PLAN §4.4), or revert.

## When you ask the operator something

- Use AskUserQuestion for choices, not free-form questions that the operator could answer just by reading what's in front of them.
- Spend up to a minute on read-only investigation first. Don't interrupt with a question that grep would answer.
